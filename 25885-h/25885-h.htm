<h2>I</h2>
</div>

<p>The fine old house stood on Jumping
Tom Hill, above the town. It had
stood there before there was a town, when only
a cabin or two fringed the woods below, nearer
the shore. The weather boarding had been
brought in ships from England, ready sawed;
likewise the bricks of the chimney. Indians
used to come to the house in the cold of winter,
begging shelter. Given blankets, and
food, and drink, they slept upon the kitchen
floor; and when Joel Shore&#8217;s great-great-grandfather
came down in the morning, he found Indians
and blankets gone together. Sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
the Indians came back with a venison haunch,
or a bear steak ... sometimes not at all.
</p>
<p>The house had, now, the air of disuse which
old New England houses often have. It was
in perfect repair; its paint was white, and its
shutters hung squarely at the windows. But
the grass was uncut in the yard, and the lack
of a veranda, and the tight-closed doors and
windows, made the house seem lifeless and
lacking the savor of human presence. There
was a white-painted picket fence around the
yard; and a rambler rose draped these pickets.
The buds on the rose were bursting into crimson
flower.
</p>
<p>The house was four-square, plain, and without
any ornamentation. It was built about a
great, square chimney that was like a spine.
There were six flues in this chimney, and a pot
atop each flue. These little chimney pots
breaking the severe outlines of the house, gave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
the only suggestion of lightness or frivolity
about it. They were like the heads of impish
children, peeping over a fence....
</p>
<p>Across the front of this house, on the second
floor, ran a single, long room like a corridor.
Its windows looked down, across the town, to
the Harbor. A glass hung in brackets on the
wall; there was a hog-yoke in its case upon a
little table, and a ship&#8217;s chronometer, and a
compass.... There were charts in a tin
tube upon the wall, and one that showed the
Harbor and the channel to the sea hung between
the middle windows. In the north corner,
a harpoon, and two lances, and a boat spade
leaned. Their blades were covered with
wooden sheaths, painted gray. A fifteen-foot
jawbone, cleaned and polished and with every
curving tooth in place, hung upon the rear wall
and gleamed like old and yellow ivory. The
chair at the table was fashioned of whalebone;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
and on a bracket above the table rested the
model of a whaling ship, not more than eighteen
inches long, fashioned of sperm ivory and
perfect in every detail. Even the tiny harpoons
in the boats that hung along the rail were
tipped with bits of steel....
</p>
<p>The windows of this place were tight closed;
nevertheless, the room was filled with the harsh,
strong smell of the sea.
</p>
<p>Joel Shore sat in the whalebone chair, at the
table, reading a book. The book was the Log
of the House of Shore. Joel&#8217;s father had begun
it, when Joel and his four brothers were
ranging from babyhood through youth....
A full half of the book was filled with entries in
old Matthew Shore&#8217;s small, cramped hand.
The last of these entries was very short. It began
with a date, and it read:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wind began light, from the south. This
day came into Harbor the bark <i>Winona</i>, after a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
cruise of three years, two months, and four
days. Captain Chase reported that my eldest
son, Matthew Shore, was killed by the fluke of
a right whale, at Christmas Island. The whale
yielded seventy barrels of oil. Matthew Shore
was second mate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And below, upon a single line, like an epitaph,
the words:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;All the brothers were valiant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Two days after, the old man sickened; and
three weeks later, he died. He had set great
store by big Matt....
</p>
<p>Joel, turning the leaves of the Log, and scanning
their brief entries, came presently to this&mdash;written
in the hand of his brother John:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wind easterly. This day the <i>Betty</i> was
reported lost on the Japan grounds, with all
hands save the boy and the cook. Noah Shore
was third mate. Day ended as it began.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And below, again, that single line:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;All the brothers were valiant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>There followed many pages filled with reports
of rich cruises, when ships came home
with bursting casks, and the brothers of the
House of Shore played the parts of men. The
entries were now in the hand of one, now of another;
John and Mark and Joel.... Joel
read phrases here and there....
</p>
<p>&#8220;This day the <i>Martin Wilkes</i> returned ... two
years, eleven months and twenty-two days ... died
on the cruise, and first mate John
Shore became captain. Day ended as it began.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And, a page or two further on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;... <i>Martin Wilkes</i> ... two years, two
months, four days ... tubs on deck filled with
oil, for which there was no more room in the
casks ... Captain John Shore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark Shore&#8217;s first entry in the Log stood out
from the others; for Mark&#8217;s hand was bold, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
strong, and the letters sprawled blackly along
the lines. Furthermore, Mark used the personal
pronoun, while the other brothers wrote
always in the third person. Mark had written:
</p>
<p>&#8220;This day, I, Mark Shore, at the age of
twenty-seven, was given command of the whaling
bark <i>Nathan Ross</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel read this sentence thrice. There was a
bold pride in it, and a strong and reckless note
which seemed to bring his brother before his
very eyes. Mark had always been so, swift of
tongue, and strong, and sure. Joel turned another
page, came to where Mark had written:
</p>
<p>&#8220;This day I returned from my first cruise
with full casks in two years, seven months,
fifteen days. I found the <i>Martin Wilkes</i> in the
dock. They report Captain John Shore lost at
Vau Vau in an effort to save the ship&#8217;s boy,
who had fallen overboard. The boy was also
lost.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>And, below, in bold and defiant letters:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;All the brothers were valiant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>There were two more pages of entries, in
Mark&#8217;s hand or in Joel&#8217;s, before the end.
When he came to the fresh page, Joel dipped
his pen, and huddled his broad shoulders over
the book, and slowly wrote that which had to
be written.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wind northeast, light,&#8221; he began, according
to the ancient form of the sea, which makes
the state of wind and weather of first and foremost
import. &#8220;Wind northeast, light. This
day the <i>Martin Wilkes</i> finished a three year
cruise. Found in port the <i>Nathan Ross</i>. She
reports that Captain Mark Shore left the ship
when she watered at the Gilbert Islands. He
did not return, and could not be found. They
searched three weeks. They encountered hostile
islanders. No trace of Mark Shore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he had written thus far, he read the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
record to himself, his lips moving; then he sat
for a space with frowning brows, thinking,
thinking, wondering if there were a chance....
</p>
<p>But in the end he cast the hope aside. If
Mark lived, they would have found him, would
surely have found him....
</p>
<p>And so Joel wrote the ancient line:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;All the brothers were valiant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And below, as an afterthought, he added:
&#8220;Joel Shore became first mate of the <i>Martin
Wilkes</i> on her cruise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He blotted this line, and closed the book,
and put it away. Then he went to the windows
that looked down upon the Harbor, and
stood there for a long time. His face was
serene, but his eyes were faintly troubled. He
did not see the things that lay outspread below
him.
</p>
<p>Yet they were worth seeing. The town was
old, and it had the fragrance of age about it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>Below Joel, on the hill&#8217;s slopes, among the
trees, stood the square white houses of the town
folk. Beyond them, the white spire of the
church with its weather vane atop. Joel
marked that the wind was still northeast. The
vane swung fitfully in the light air. He could
see the masts and yards of the ships along the
waterfront. The yards of the <i>Nathan Ross</i>
were canted in mournful tribute to his brother.
At the pier end beside her, he marked the ranks
of casks, brown with sweating oil. Beyond,
the smooth water ruffled in the wind, and dark
ripple-shadows moved across its surface with
each breeze. There were gulls in the air, and
on the water. Such stillness lay upon the
sleepy town that if his windows had been open,
he might have heard the harsh cries of the birds.
A man was sculling shoreward from a fishing
schooner that lay at anchor off the docks; and
a whaleboat crawled like a spider across the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
harbor toward Fairhaven on the other side.
</p>
<p>On a flag staff above a big building near the
water, a half-masted flag hung idly in the
faintly stirring air. It hung there, he knew,
for his brother&#8217;s sake. He watched it thoughtfully,
wondering.... There had been such
an abounding insolence of life in big Mark
Shore.... It was hard to believe that he was
surely dead.
</p>
<p>A woman passed along the street below the
house, and looked up and saw him at the window.
He did not see her. Two boys crawled
along the white picket fence, and pricked their
fingers as they broke half-open clusters from
the rambler without molestation. A gray
squirrel, when the boys had gone, came down
from an elm across the street and sprinted desperately
to the foot of the great oak below the
house. When it was safe in the oak&#8217;s upper
branches, it scolded derisively at the imaginary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
terrors it had escaped. A blue jay, with ruffled
feathers&mdash;a huge, blue ball in the air&mdash;rocketed
across from the elm, and established himself
near the squirrel, and they swore at each other
like coachmen. The squirrel swore from
temper and disposition; the jay from malice
and derision. The bird seemed to have the better
of the argument, for the squirrel suddenly
fell silent and departed, his emotions revealing
themselves only in the angry flicks of his tail.
When he was gone, the jay began to investigate
a knot in a limb of the oak. The bird climbed
around this knot with slow motions curiously
like those of a parrot.
</p>
<p>A half-grown boy came up the street and
turned in at the gate. Joel remained where he
was until the boy manipulated the knocker on
the door; then he went down and opened. He
knew the boy; Peter How. Peter was thin and
freckled and nervous; and he was inclined to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
stammer. When Joel opened the door, Peter
was at first unable to speak. He stood on the
step, jerking his chin upward and forward as
though his collar irked him. Joel smiled
slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Peter,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Peter jerked his chin, jerked his whole head
furiously. &#8220;C&mdash;C&mdash;C&mdash;&#8221; he said. &#8220;Asa W-W-Worthen
wants to s-s-see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Asa Worthen was the owner of the <i>Martin
Wilkes</i>, and of the <i>Nathan Ross</i>. Joel
nodded gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Peter,&#8221; he told the boy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get my hat and come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peter jerked his head. He seemed to be
choking. &#8220;He&#8217;s a-a-a-a-at his office,&#8221; he
blurted.
</p>
<p>Joel had found his hat. He closed the door
of the house behind him, and he and Peter went
down the shady street together.
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
<h2>II</h2>
</div>

<p>Asa Worthen was a small, lean, strong
old man, immensely voluble. He must
have been well over sixty years old; and he had
grown rich by harvesting the living treasures of
the sea. At thirty-four, he owned his first ship.
She was old, and cranky, and no more seaworthy
than a log; but she earned him more
than four hundred thousand dollars, net, before
he beached her on the sand below the town.
She lay there still, her upper parts strong and
well preserved. But her bottom was gone, and
she was slowly rotting into the sand.
</p>
<p>Asa himself had captained this old craft, until
she had served her appointed time; but when
she went to the sand flats, he, too, stayed ashore,
to watch his ships come in. When they were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
in harbor, they berthed in his own dock; and
from his office at the shoreward end of the pier,
he could look down upon their decks, and watch
the casks come out, so fat with oil, and the
stores go aboard for each cruise. The cries of
the men and the wheeling gulls, the rattle of
the blocks and gear, and the rich smell of the
oil came up to him.... The <i>Nathan Ross</i>
was loading now; and when Joel climbed the
office stairs, he found the old man at the window
watching them sling great shooks of staves
into her hold, and fidgeting at the lubberliness
of the men who did the work.
</p>
<p>Asa&#8217;s office was worth seeing; a strange,
huge room, windowed on three sides; against
one wall, a whaleboat with all her gear in
place; in a corner, the twisted jaw of a sixty-barrel
bull, killed in the Seychelles; and Asa
Worthen&#8217;s big desk, with a six-foot model of
his old ship atop it, between the forward windows.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
Beside the desk stood that contrivance
known to the whalemen as a &#8220;woman&#8217;s tub&#8221;;
a cask, sawed chair-fashion, with a cross board
for seat, and ropes so rigged that the whole
might be easily and safely swung from ship
to small boat or back again. Asa had taken
his wife along on more than one of his early
voyages ... before she died....
</p>
<p>At Joel&#8217;s step, the little man swung awkwardly
away from the window, toward the
door. Many years ago, a racing whale line had
snarled his left leg and whipped away a gout of
muscle; and this leg was now shorter than its
fellow, so that Asa walked with a pegging limp.
He hitched across the big room, and took Joel&#8217;s
arm, and led the young man to the desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Joel. Sit down,&#8221; he said briskly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve words to say to you, my son. Sit down.&#8221;
Asa was smoking; and Joel took a twist of leaf
from his pocket, and cut three slices, and crumbled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
them and stuffed them into the bowl of
his black pipe. Asa watched the process, and
he watched Joel, puffing without comment.
There was something furtive in the scrutiny of
the young man, but Joel did not mark it.
When the pipe was ready, Asa passed across
a match, and Joel struck it, and puffed
slowly....
</p>
<p>Asa began, abruptly, what he had to say.
&#8220;Joel, the <i>Nathan Ross</i> will be ready for sea
in five days. She&#8217;s stout, her timbers are good
and her tackle is strong. She&#8217;s a lucky ship.
The oil swims after her across the broad sea,
and begs to be taken. She&#8217;s my pet ship, Joel,
as you know; and she&#8217;s uncommon well fitted.
Mark had her. Now I want you to take her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel&#8217;s calm eyes had met the other&#8217;s while
Asa was speaking; and Asa had shifted to avoid
the encounter. But Joel&#8217;s heart was pounding
so, at the words of the older man, that he took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
no heed. He listened, and he waited thoughtfully
until he was sure of what he wished to
say. Then he asked quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is not James Finch the mate of her? Did
he not fetch her home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said Asa impatiently. &#8220;He brought
her home&mdash;in the top scurry of haste. There
was no need of such haste; for he had still
casks unfilled, and there was sparm all about
him where he lay. He should have filled those
last casks. &#8217;Tis in them the profit lies.&#8221; He
shook his head sorrowfully. &#8220;No, Jim Finch
will not do. He is a good man&mdash;under another
man. But he has not the spine that
stands alone. When Mark Shore was gone  ...
Jim had no thought but to throw the try works
overside and scurry hitherward as though he
feared to be out upon the seas alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel puffed thrice at his pipe. Then:
&#8220;You said this morning that for three weeks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
he hunted Mark, up and down the Gilbert
Islands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Asa&#8217;s little eyes whipped toward Joel, and
away again. &#8220;Oh, aye,&#8221; he said harshly.
&#8220;Three weeks he hunted, when one was plenty.
If Mark Shore lived, and wished to find his
ship again, he&#8217;d have found her in a week. If
he were dead ... there was no need of the
time wasted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; said Joel quietly, &#8220;James
Finch has my thanks for his search; and I&#8217;m
no mind to do him a harm, or to step into his
shoes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Asa smiled grimly. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re over considerate,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Jim Finch was your brother&#8217;s
man, and a very loyal one. As long as he is another&#8217;s
man, he is content. But he has no want
to be his own master and the master of a ship,
and of men. I&#8217;ve askit him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel puffed hard at his pipe; and after a little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
he asked: &#8220;Sir, what think you it was that
came to Mark?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Asa looked at him sharply, then away; and
his accustomed volubility fell away from him.
He lifted his hands. &#8220;Ask James Finch.
I&#8217;ve no way to tell,&#8221; he said curtly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you no opinion?&#8221; Joel insisted.
</p>
<p>The ship owner tilted his head, set finger tip
to finger tip, assumed the air of one who delivers
judgment. &#8220;Islanders, &#8217;tis like,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a many there.&#8221; He looked sidewise
at Joel, looked away. Joel was nodding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, many thereabouts,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But
there would have been tracks. Were there
none?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark left his boat&#8217;s crew,&#8221; said Asa.
&#8220;Walked away along the shore. That was all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No tracks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They saw where he&#8217;d left the sand.&#8221; The
ship owner shifted in his chair. &#8220;Seems like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
I&#8217;d heard you and Mark wa&#8216;n&#8217;t too good
friends, Joel. Your a&#8217;mighty worked up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel looked at the little man with bleak eyes.
&#8220;He was my brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard tell he forgot you was his, sometimes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel paid no heed. &#8220;You think it was
Islanders?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Asa kicked the corner of his desk, watching
his foot. &#8220;What else was there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing in my mind,&#8221; said Joel, and
shook his head. &#8220;But it sticks in me that Mark
was no man to die easy. There was a full
measure of life in him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Asa got up awkwardly, waved his hand.
&#8220;We&#8217;re off the course, Joel. What about the
<i>Nathan Ross</i>? Ready for sea, come Tuesday.
I&#8217;m not one to press her on any man, unwilling.
Say your say, man. Do you take her? Or
no?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>Joel drew slowly once more upon his pipe.
&#8220;If I take her,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll work the Gilberts
first of all, and try once again for a sign
of my brother Mark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Asa jerked his head. &#8220;So you pick up any
oil that comes your way, I&#8217;ve no objection,&#8221;
he agreed. &#8220;Matter of fact, that&#8217;s the best
thing to do. Mark may yet live.&#8221; His eyes
snapped up to the others. &#8220;You take her,
then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel nodded slowly. &#8220;I take her, sir,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;With thanks to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Asa banged his hand jubilantly on his desk.
&#8220;That&#8217;s done. Now ...&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two men sat down at Asa&#8217;s big desk
again; and for an hour they were busy with
matters that concerned the coming cruise.
When a whaleship goes to sea, she goes for a
three-year cruise; and save only the items of
food and water, she carries with her everything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
she will need for that whole time, with an ample
allowance to spare. She is a department
store of the seas; for she works with iron and
wood, with steel and bone, with fire and water
and rope and sail. All these things she must
have, and many more. And the lists of a
whaleship&#8217;s stores are long and long, and take
much checking. When they had considered
these matters, Asa sent out to the pierhead to
summon Jim Finch, and told the man that Joel
would have the ship. Joel said to Finch
slowly: &#8220;I&#8217;ve no mind to fight a grudge
aboard my ship, sir. If you blame me for stepping
into your shoes, Mr. Worthen will give
you another berth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finch shook his head. He was a big, laughing
man with soft, fat cheeks. &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;It&#8217;s yours, and welcome. Your
brother was a man; and you&#8217;ve the look of
another, sir.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>Joel frowned. He was uncomfortable; he
had an angry feeling that Finch was too amiable.
But he said no more, and Finch went
back to the ship, and Asa and Joel continued
with their task.
</p>
<p>While they worked, the afternoon sun drifted
down the western sky till its level rays were
flame lances laid across the harbor. A fishing
craft at anchor in mid-stream hoisted her
sails with a creak and rattle of blocks and
drifted down the channel with the tide. The
wheeling gulls dropped, one by one, to the
water; or they lurched off to some quiet cove
to spend the night. Their harsh cries came
less frequently, were less persistent. The wind
had swung around, and it was fetching now
from the water a cold and salty chill. There
was a smell of cooking in the air, and the smoke
from the <i>Nathan Ross</i>&#8217; galley, and the cool
smell of the sea mingled with the strong odor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
of the oil in the casks ranked at the end of the
pier.
</p>
<p>The sun had touched the horizon when Joel
at last rose to go. Asa got up with him,
dropped a hand on the young man&#8217;s shoulder.
They passed the contrivance called a &#8220;woman&#8217;s
tub&#8221;; and Asa, at sight of it, seemed to be
minded of something. He stopped, and
checked Joel, and with eyes twinkling, pointed
to the tub. &#8220;Will you be wishful to take that
on the cruise, Joel?&#8221; he asked, and looked up
sidewise at the younger man, and chuckled.
</p>
<p>Joel&#8217;s brown cheeks were covered with slow
fire; but his voice was steady enough when he
replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s a kind offer, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
know well what store you set by that tub.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be wanting it?&#8221; Asa still insisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said Joel quietly. &#8220;I will see.&#8221;

<h2>III</h2>
</div>

<p>The brothers of the House of Shore had
been, on the whole, slow to take to
themselves wives. Matt had never married,
nor Noah, nor Mark. John had a wife for the
weeks he was at home before his last cruise;
but he did not take her with him on that voyage,
and there was no John Shore to carry on
the name.
</p>
<p>John Shore&#8217;s widow was called Rachel. She
had been Rachel Holt; and her sister&#8217;s name
was Priscilla. Rachel was one of those women
who suggest slumbering fires; she was slow of
speech, and quiet, and calm.... But John
Shore and Mark had both loved her; and when
she married John, Mark laughed a hard and
reckless laugh that made the woman afraid.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
John and Mark never spoke, one to another,
after that marriage.
</p>
<p>Rachel&#8217;s sister, Priscilla, was a gay and careless
child. She was six years younger than
Joel, and she had acquired in babyhood the
habit of thinking Joel the most wonderful created
thing. Their yards adjoined; and she was
the baby of her family, and he of his. Thus
the big boy and the little girl had always been
comrades and allies against the world. Before
Joel first went to sea, as ship&#8217;s boy, the two
had decided they would some day be married....
</p>
<p>Joel went to supper that night at Priscilla&#8217;s
home. He was alone in his own house; and
Mrs. Holt was a person with a mother&#8217;s heart.
Rachel lived at home. She gave Joel quiet
welcome at the door, before Priscilla in the
kitchen heard his voice and came flying to overwhelm
him. She had been making popovers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
and there was flour on her fingers&mdash;and on
Joel&#8217;s best black coat, when she was done with
him. Rachel brushed it off, when Priss had
run back to her oven.
</p>
<p>They sat down at table. Mrs. Holt at one
end, her husband&mdash;he was a big man, an old
sea captain, and full of yarns as a knitting
bag&mdash;at the other; and Rachel at one side,
facing Priss and Joel. Joel&#8217;s ship had come
in only that day; the <i>Nathan Ross</i> had been in
port for weeks. So the whole town knew Mark
Shore&#8217;s story. They spoke of it now, and
Joel told them what he knew.... Rachel
wondered if there was any chance that Mark
might still be alive. Her father broke in with
a story of Mark&#8217;s first cruise, when the boy had
saved a man&#8217;s life by his quickness with the
hatchet on the racing line. The town was full
of such stories; for Mark was one of those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
men about whom legends arise. And now he
was gone....
</p>
<p>Priscilla listened to the talk with the wide
eyes of youth, awed by the mystery and majesty
of tragic things. She remembered Mark
as a huge man, like a pagan god, in whose eyes
she had been only a thin-legged little girl who
made faces through the fence.... After supper,
when the others had left them in the parlor
together, she said to Joel: &#8220;Do you think
he&#8217;s dead?&#8221; Her voice was a whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I aim to know,&#8221; said Joel.
</p>
<p>Rachel looked in at the door. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t bother with the dishes, Priss,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priscilla had forgotten all about that task.
She ran contritely toward her sister. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m
sorry, Rachel. I will, I will do them. Joel
and I....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>Rachel laughed softly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind them.
You two stay here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priscilla accepted the offer, in the end; but
she had no notion of staying in the tight-windowed
parlor, with its harsh carpet on the floor,
and its samplers on the walls. She was of the
new generation, the generation which discovered
that the night is beautiful, and not unhealthy.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go outside,&#8221; she said to Joel. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a moon. We can sit on the bench, under the
apple tree....&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went out, side by side. Joel was not
a tall man, but he was inches taller than Priscilla.
She was tiny; a dainty, sweetly proportioned
creature, built on fine lines that were
strangely out of keeping with the stalwart stock
from which she sprung. Her hair was darker
than Joel&#8217;s; it was a brown so dark that it was
almost black. But her eyes were vividly blue,
and her lips were vividly red, and her cheeks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
were bright.... She slipped her hand through
Joel&#8217;s big arm as they crossed the yard; and
when they had found the seat, she drew his arm
frankly about her shoulders. &#8220;I&#8217;m cold,&#8221; she
said, laughing up at him. &#8220;You must keep me
warm....&#8221;
</p>
<p>The moon flecked down through the leaves
upon her face. There was moonlight on her
cheek, and on her mouth; but her thick hair and
her eyes were shadowed and mysterious. Joel
saw that her lips were smiling.... She drew
his head down toward hers.... Joel was
flesh and blood; and she panted, and gasped,
and pushed him away, and smoothed her hair,
and laughed at him. &#8220;I love you to be so
strong,&#8221; she whispered, happily.
</p>
<p>He had not told them, at supper, of his promotion.
He told Priscilla now; and the girl
could not sit still beside him. She danced in
the path before the seat; she perched on his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
knee, and caught his big shoulders in her tiny
hands and tried to shake him back and forth
in her delight. &#8220;You don&#8217;t act a bit excited,&#8221;
she scolded. &#8220;You don&#8217;t act as though you
were glad, a bit. Aren&#8217;t you glad, Joe?
Aren&#8217;t you just so proud?...&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;Of course. Yes.
Yes, I am glad, and I am proud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I could&mdash;I could just hug
you in two.&#8221; She tried it, tightening her arms
about his big neck, clinging to him.... He
sat stiff and awkward under her caresses, thrilling
with a happiness that he did not know how
to express. He felt uneasy, half embarrassed.
Her ecstasy continued....
</p>
<p>Then, abruptly, it passed. She became practical.
Still upon his knee, she began to ask
questions. When would he sail away? She
had heard the <i>Nathan Ross</i> was almost ready.
When would he come back? When would he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
be rich, so that they might be married?
Would it be long?...
</p>
<p>Joel found tongue. &#8220;We will be married
Monday,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;We will go away&mdash;on
the <i>Nathan Ross</i>&mdash;together. I do not
want to go alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She slipped from his knee, stood before him.
&#8220;Why, Joel! You&#8217;re&mdash;you&#8217;re just crazy to
think of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No, I
have thought all about it. It is the best thing
to do. We will be married Monday; and we
will make a bigger cabin on the&mdash;<i>Nathan
Ross</i>....&#8221; His voice always slowed a little
as he spoke the name of his first ship. &#8220;You
will be happy on her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You will like
it all.... The sea....&#8221;
</p>
<p>She returned to his knee, tumbling his hair.
&#8220;You silly! Men don&#8217;t understand. Why, I
couldn&#8217;t be ready for ever so long. And I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
wouldn&#8217;t dare go away with you. For so awfully
long. I just couldn&#8217;t....&#8221; Her eyes
misted with thought, and she said quite seriously:
&#8220;Why, Joel, we might find we didn&#8217;t
like each other at all. But we&#8217;d be on the ship,
with no way to get away from it ... for three
years. Don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said calmly: &#8220;That is not so; because
we know about&mdash;liking each other, already. I
know how it is with you. It is clothes that
you are thinking about. Well, you can get
them in the stores. And you have many, already.
You have new dresses whenever I see
you....&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed gayly. &#8220;But, Joel, you only see
me once in three years. Of course I have new
dresses, then. But I just couldn&#8217;t....&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed again, a faint uneasiness in her
laughter. She left his knee, and sat down soberly
beside him. She was feeling a little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
crushed, smothered ... as though she were being
pushed back against a wall. Joel said
steadily:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Worthen will be glad to know you go
with me. And every one will be glad for
you....&#8221;
</p>
<p>She burst, abruptly, into tears. She was miserable,
she told him. He was making her miserable.
She hated to be bullied, and he was
trying to bully her. She hated him. She
wouldn&#8217;t marry him. Never. He could go off
on his old ship and never come back. That was
all. She would not go; and he ought not to ask
her to, anyway. To prove how much she hated
him, she nestled against his side, and his arm
enfolded her.
</p>
<p>Joel had not the outward seeming of a wise
man; nevertheless he now said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The other girls will all be envying you. To
be married so quickly, and carried away the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
very next day....&#8221; Her sobs miraculously
ceased, and he smiled quietly down upon her
dark head against his breast. &#8220;Every one will
do things for you.... The whole town....
They will come down to see us sail away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He fell silent, leaving his words for her consideration.
She remained very quiet against
his side for a long time, breathing very softly.
He thought he could almost read her
thoughts....
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be,&#8221; he said, &#8220;like a story. Like a
romance.&#8221; And the word sounded strangely on
his sober lips.
</p>
<p>But at the word, the girl sat up quickly, both
hands gripping his arm. He could see her eyes
dancing in the moonlight.... &#8220;Oh, Joe,&#8221;
she cried, &#8220;it would really be just loads of
fun. And terribly romantic.... Wonderful!&#8221;
She pressed a hand to her cheek, thinking:
&#8220;And I could....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>She could, she said, do thus and so....
</p>
<p>Joel listened, and he smiled. For he knew
that his bride would sail away with him.
</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
</div>

<p>In the few days that remained before the <i>Nathan
Ross</i> was to sail, there was no time for
remodeling her cabin to accommodate Priscilla;
so that was left for the first weeks of the cruise.
There were matters enough, without it, to occupy
those last days. Little Priss was caught
up like a leaf in the wind; she was whirled this
way and that in a pleasant and heart-stirring
confusion. And through it all, her laughter
rang in the air like the sound of bells. To
Joel, Sunday night, she said: &#8220;Oh, Joe ... it&#8217;s
been an awful rush. But it&#8217;s been such fun.... And
I never was so happy in my life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Joel smiled, and said quietly: &#8220;Yes&mdash;with
happier times to come.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>She looked up at him wistfully. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be
good to me, won&#8217;t you, Joel?&#8221; He patted her
shoulder.
</p>
<p>They were married in the big old white
church, and every pew was filled. Afterwards
they all went down to the piers, where Asa
Worthen had spread long tables and loaded
them so that they groaned. Alongside lay the
<i>Nathan Ross</i>, her decks littered with the last
confusion of preparation. Joel showed Priscilla
the lumber for the cabin alterations, ranked
along the rail beneath the boathouse; and she
gripped his arm tight with both hands. Afterwards,
he took Priscilla up the hill to the great
House of Shore. Rachel had prepared their
wedding supper there....
</p>
<p>At a quarter before ten o&#8217;clock the next morning,
the <i>Nathan Ross</i> went out with the tide.
When she had cleared the dock and was fairly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
in the stream, Joel gave her in charge of Jim
Finch; and he and Priscilla stood in the after
house, astern, and looked back at the throng
upon the pier until the individual figures
merged into a black mass, pepper-and-salted
with color where the women stood. They
could see the handkerchiefs flickering, until a
turn of the channel swept them out of sight of
the town, and they drifted on through the widening
mouth of the bay, toward the open sea.
At dusk that night, there was still land in sight
behind them and on either side; but when Priscilla
came on deck in the morning, there was
nothing but blue water and laughing waves.
And so she was homesick, all that day, and
laughed not at all till the evening, when the
moon bathed the ship in silver fire, and the
white-caps danced all about them.
</p>
<p>The <i>Nathan Ross</i> was in no sense a lovely
ship. There was about her none of the poetry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
of the seas. She was designed strictly for utility,
and for hard and dirty toil. Blunt she was
of bow and stern, and her widest point was just
abeam the foremast, so that she had great shoulders
that buffeted the sea. These shoulders
bent inward toward the prow and met in what
was practically a right angle; and her stern was
cut almost straight across, with only enough
overhang to give the rudder room. Furthermore,
her masts had no rake. They stood up
stiff and straight as sore thumbs; and the bowsprit,
instead of being something near horizontal,
rose toward the skies at an angle close to
forty-five degrees. This bowsprit made the
<i>Nathan Ross</i> look as though she had just
stubbed her toe. She carried four boats at the
davits; and two spare craft, bottom up, on the
boathouse just forward of the mizzenmast.
Three of the four at the davits were on the starboard
side, and since they were each thirty feet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
long, while the ship herself was scarce a hundred
and twenty, they gave her a sadly cluttered
and overloaded appearance. For the rest, she
was painted black, with a white checkerboarding
around the rail; and her sails were smeared
and smutty with smoke from burning blubber
scraps.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she was a comfortable ship,
and a dry one. She rode waves that would
have swept a vessel cut on prouder lines; and
she was moderately steady. She was not fast,
nor cared to be. An easy five or six knots contented
her; for the whole ocean was her hunting
ground, and though there were certain more
favored areas, you might meet whales anywhere.
Give her time, and she would poke
that blunt nose of hers right &#8217;round the world,
and come back with a net profit anywhere up to
a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in her
sweating casks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>Priscilla Holt knew all these things, and she
respected the <i>Nathan Ross</i> on their account.
But during the first weeks of the cruise, she was
too much interested in the work on the cabin to
consider other matters. Old Aaron Burnham,
the carpenter, did the work. He was a wiry
little man, gray and grizzled; and he loved the
tools of his craft with a jealous love that forbade
the laying on of impious hands. Through
the long, calm days, when the ship snored like
a sleep-walker through the empty seas, Priscilla
would sit on box or bench or floor, and watch
Aaron at his task, and ask him questions, and
listen to the old man&#8217;s long stories of things that
had come and gone.
</p>
<p>Sometimes she tried to help him; but he
would not let her handle an edged tool. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll
no have the eye for it,&#8221; he would say. &#8220;Leave
it be.&#8221; Now and then he let her try to drive a
nail; but as often as not she missed the nail head
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
and marred the soft wood, until Aaron lost patience
with her. &#8220;Mark you,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;men
will see the scar there, and they&#8217;ll be thinking
I did this task with my foot, Ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Priscilla would laugh at him, and curl
up with her feet tucked under her skirts and
her chin in her hands, and watch him by the
long hour on hour.
</p>
<p>The task dragged on; it seemed to her endless.
For Aaron had other work that must be
done, and he could give only his spare time to
this. Also, he was a slow worker, accustomed
to take his own time; and when Priscilla grew
impatient and scolded him, the old man merely
sat back on his knees, and scratched his head,
and tapped thoughtfully with his hammer on
the floor beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We-ell, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do things so,
and I do things so; and it takes time, that does,
Ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>Now and then, through those days, Priscilla&#8217;s
enthusiasm would send her skittering up the
companion to fetch Joel to see some new wonder&mdash;a
window set in the stern, or a bench completed,
or a door hung. And Joel, looking far
oftener at Priscilla than at the object she wished
him to consider, would chuckle, and touch her
shoulder affectionately, and go back to his post.
</p>
<p>In the sixth week, the last nail had been
driven, and the last lick of paint was dry. In
the result, Priscilla was as happy as a bride has
a right to be.
</p>
<p>Across the very stern of the ship, with windows
looking out upon the wake, ran what
might have been called a sitting room. It was
perhaps twenty feet wide and eight feet deep;
and its rear wall&mdash;formed by the overhanging
stern&mdash;sloped outward toward the ceiling.
Against this slope, beneath the three windows, a
broad, cushioned bench was built, to serve as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
couch or seat. The bench was broken in one
place to make room for Joel&#8217;s desk, and the cabinet
wherein he kept his records and his instruments.
Priss had put curtains on the windows;
and she had a lily, in a pot, at one of them, and
a clump of pansies at another. Joel&#8217;s cabin
opened off this compartment, on the starboard
side; hers was opposite. The main cabin, with
its folding table built about the thick butt of
the mizzenmast, had been extended forward to
make room for the enlargement of this stern
apartment; and the mates were quartered off
this main cabin. The galley and the store
rooms were on the main deck, in the after house,
on either side of the awkward &#8220;walking wheel&#8221;
by which the ship was steered; and the cabin
companion was just forward of this wheel.
</p>
<p>There were aboard the <i>Nathan Ross</i> about
thirty men, all told; but the most of them were
not of Priscilla&#8217;s world. The foremast hands
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
never came aft of the try works, save on tasks
assigned; and the secondary officers&mdash;boat-steerers
and the like&mdash;slept in the steerage and kept
forward of the boathouse. Thus the after deck
was shared only by Priscilla and Joel, the
mates, the cook, and old Aaron, who was a man
of many privileges.
</p>
<p>This world, Priscilla ruled. Joel adored
her; Jim Finch gave her the clumsy homage of
a puppy&mdash;and was at times just as oppressively
amiable. Old Aaron talked to her by the hour,
while he went about his work. And the other
mates&mdash;Varde, the sullen; and Hooper, who
was old and losing his grip; and Dick Morrell,
who was young and finding his&mdash;paid her the
respect that was her due. Young Morrell&mdash;he
was not even as old as she was&mdash;helped her
on her first climb to the mast head. He was
only a boy.... The girl, when the first homesick
pangs were past, was happy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>Until the day they killed their whale, a seventy-barrel
cachalot cow who died as peaceably
as a chicken, with only a convulsive flop or two
when the lances found the life. Priscilla took
a single glimpse of the shuddering, bloody, oily
work of cutting in the carcass, and then she fled
to her cabin and remained there steadfastly until
the long task was done. The smoke from
the bubbling try pots, and the persistent smell
of boiling blubber sickened her; and the grime
that descended over everything appalled her
dainty soul. Not until the men had cleaned
ship did she go on deck again; and even then
she scolded Joel for the affair as though it were
a matter for which he was wholly to blame.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There just isn&#8217;t any sense in making so much
dirt,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had to wash out
every one of my curtains; and I can&#8217;t ever get
rid of that smell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel chuckled. &#8220;Aye, the smell sticks,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
agreed. &#8220;But you&#8217;ll be used to it soon, Priss.
You&#8217;ll come to like it, I&#8217;m thinking. Any case,
we&#8217;ll not be rid of it while the cruise is on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was so angry that she wanted to cry.
&#8220;Do you actually mean, Joel Shore, that I&#8217;ve
got to live with that sickening, hot-oil smell for
th-three years?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. &#8220;Yes, Priss. No way
out of it. It&#8217;s part of the work. Come another
month, and you&#8217;ll not mind at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She said positively: &#8220;I may not say anything,
but I shall always hate that smell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His eyes twinkled slowly; and she stamped
her foot. &#8220;If I&#8217;d known it was going to be like
this, I wouldn&#8217;t have come, Joel. Now don&#8217;t
you laugh at me. If there was any way to go
back, I&#8217;d go. I hate it. I hate it all. You
ought not to have brought me....&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were on the broad bench across the
stern, in their cabin; and he put his big arm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
about her shoulders and laughed at her till she
could do no less than laugh back at him. But&mdash;she
assured herself of this&mdash;she was angry,
just the same. Nevertheless, she laughed....
</p>
<p>Joel had put the <i>Nathan Ross</i> on the most
direct southward course, touching neither Azores
nor Cape Verdes. For it was in his mind, as he
had told Asa Worthen, to make direct for the
Gilbert Islands and seek some trace of his
brother there. That had been his plan before
he left port; but the plan had become determination
after a word with Aaron Burnham, one
day. Joel, resting in the cabin while old Aaron
worked there, fell to thinking of his brother,
and so asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaron, what is your belief about my brother,
Mark Shore? Is he dead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Aaron was building, that day, the forward
partition of the new cabin, fitting his boards
meticulously, and driving home each nail with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
hammer strokes that seemed smooth and effortless,
yet sank the nail to the head in an instant.
He looked up over his shoulder at Joel, between
nails.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead, d&#8217;ye say?&#8221; he countered quizzically.
</p>
<p>Joel nodded. &#8220;The Islanders? Did they
do it, do you believe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Old Aaron chuckled asthmatically. He had
lost a fore tooth, and the effect of his mirth was
not reassuring. &#8220;There&#8217;s a brew i&#8217; the Islands,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;More like &#8217;twas the island
brew nor the island men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel, for a moment, sat very still and considered.
He knew Mark Shore had never
scrupled to take strong drink when he chose;
but Mark had always been a strong man to
match his drink, and conquer it. Said Joel,
therefore, after a space of thought:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think that, Aaron? Drink
was never like to carry Mark away.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>Aaron squinted up at him. &#8220;Have ye sampled
that island brew? &#8217;Tis made of pineapples,
or sago, or the like outlandish stuff, I&#8217;ve
heard. And one sip is deviltry, and two is
madness, and three is corruption. Some stomachs
are used to it; they can handle it. But a
raw man....&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was significance in the pause, and the
unfinished sentence. Joel considered the matter.
There had always been, between him and
Mark, something of that sleeping enmity that so
often arises between brothers. Mark was a
man swift of tongue, flashing, and full of laughter
and hot blood; a colorful man, like a splash
of pigment on white canvas. Joel was in all
things his opposite, quiet, and slow of thought
and speech, and steady of gait. Mark was accustomed
to jeer at him, to taunt him; and Joel,
in the slow fashion of slow men, had resented
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
this. Nevertheless, he cast aside prejudice now
in his estimate of the situation; and he asked
old Aaron:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know there were Islanders about?
Or this wild brew you speak of?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Aaron drove home a nail, and with his punch
set it flush with the soft wood. &#8220;There was
some drunken crew, shouting and screeching a
mile up the beach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some few of
them came off to us with fruit. The sober ones.
&#8217;Twas them Mark Shore went to pandander
with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He went to them?&#8221; Joel echoed. Aaron
nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye. That he did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a long moment of silence before
Joel asked huskily: &#8220;But was it like that he
should stay with them freely?&#8221; For it is a
black and shameful thing that a captain should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
desert his ship. When he had asked the question,
he waited in something like fear for the
carpenter&#8217;s answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes to me,&#8221; said Aaron slowly at last,
&#8220;that you did not well know your brother.
Ye&#8217;d only seen him ashore. And&mdash;I&#8217;m doubting
that you knew all the circumstances of his
departure from this ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that he went ashore,&#8221; said Joel.
&#8220;Went ashore, and left his men, and departed;
and I know that they searched for him three
weeks without a sign.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Aaron sat back on his heels, and rubbed the
smooth head of his hammer thoughtfully
against his dry old cheek. &#8220;I&#8217;m not one to
speak harm,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve said naught,
in the town. But&mdash;you have some right to
know that Mark Shore was not a sober man
when he left the ship. I&#8217; truth, he had not
been sober&mdash;cold sober&mdash;for a week. And he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
left with a bottle in his coat.&#8221; He nodded his
gray old head, eyes not on Joel, but on the hammer
in his hand. &#8220;Also, there was a pearling
schooner in the lagoon, with drunk white men
aboard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He glanced sidewise at Joel then, and saw
the Captain&#8217;s cheek bones slowly whiten.
Whereupon old Aaron bent swiftly to his task,
half fearful of what he had said. But when
Joel spoke, it was only to say quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Asa should have told me this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Aaron shook his head vehemently, but without
looking up from his task. &#8220;Not so,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;There was no need the town should
chew Mark&#8217;s name. Better&mdash;&#8221; He glanced
at Joel. &#8220;Better if he were thought dead.
Asa&#8217;s a good man, you mind. And&mdash;he knew
your father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel nodded at that. &#8220;Asa meant wisest,
I&#8217;ve no doubt,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But&mdash;Mark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
would do nothing that he was shamed of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark Shore,&#8221; said Aaron thoughtfully, &#8220;did
many things without shame for which other men
would have blushit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said curtly: &#8220;Aaron, ye&#8217;ll say no more
such things as that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re right,&#8221; Aaron agreed. &#8220;I should no
have said it. But&mdash;&#8217;tis so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel left him and went on deck, and his eyes
were troubled.... Priss was there, with Dick
Morrell showing her some trick of the wheel,
and they were laughing together like children.
Joel felt immensely older than Priss.... Yet
the difference was scarce six years.... She
saw him, and left Morrell and came running to
Joel&#8217;s side. &#8220;Did you sleep?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;You needed rest, Joe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rested,&#8221; he told her, smiling faintly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be fine....&#8221;
</p>

<h2>V</h2>
</div>

<p>They drifted past Pernambuco, and
touched at Trinidad, and so worked
south and somewhat westward for Cape Horn.
And in Joel grew, stronger and ever, the resolve
to hunt out Mark, and find him, and fetch him
home.... The blood tie was strong on Joel;
stronger than any memory of Mark&#8217;s derision.
And&mdash;for the honor of the House of Shore, it
were well to prove the matter, if Mark were
dead. It is not well for a Shore to abandon
his ship in strange seas.
</p>
<p>He asked Aaron, two weeks after their first
talk, whether they had questioned the white men
on the pearling schooner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, aye,&#8221; said Aaron cheerfully. &#8220;I sought
&#8217;em out, myself. Three of them, they was;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
and ill-favored. A slinky small man, and a
rat-eyed large man, and a fat man in between;
all unshaven, and filthy, and drunken as owls.
They&#8217;d seen naught of Mark Shore, they said.
I&#8217;m thinking he&#8217;d let them see but little of him.
He had no tenderness for dirt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel told Priss nothing of what he hoped and
feared; nor did he question Jim Finch in the
matter. Finch was a good man at set tasks, but
he was too amiable, and he had no clamp upon
his lips.... Joel did not wish the word to go
abroad among the men. He was glad that
most of the crew were new since last voyage;
but the officers were unchanged, save that he
stood in his brother&#8217;s shoes.
</p>
<p>They left Trinidad behind them, and shouldered
their way southward, the blunt bow of
the <i>Nathan Ross</i> battering the seas. And they
came to the Straits, and worked in, and made
their westing day by day, while little Priss,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
wide-eyed on the deck, watched the gaunt cliffs
past whose wave-gnawed feet they stole. And
so at last the Pacific opened out before them,
and they caught the winds, and worked toward
Easter Island.
</p>
<p>But their progress was slow. To men unschooled
in the patience of the whaling trade, it
would have been insufferably slow. For they
struck fish; and day after day they hung idle on
the waves while the trypots boiled; and day
after day they loitered on good whaling
grounds, when the boats were out thrice and
four times between sun&#8217;s rise and set. If Joel
was impatient, he gave no sign. If his desires
would have made him hasten on, his duty held
him here, where rich catches waited for the taking;
and while there were fish to be taken, he
would not leave them behind.
</p>
<p>Priscilla hated it. She hated the grime, and
the smoke, and the smell of boiling oil; and she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
hated this dawdling on the open seas, with never
a glimpse of land. More than once she made
Joel bear the brunt of her own unrest; and because
it is not always good for two people to be
too much together, and because she had nothing
better to do, she began to pick Joel to pieces in
her thoughts, and fret at his patience and stolidity.
She wished he would grow angry, wished
even that he might be angry with her.... She
wished for anything to break the long days of
deadly calm. And she watched Joel more intently
than it is well for wife to watch husband,
or for husband to watch wife.
</p>
<p>He did so many things that tried her sore.
He had a fashion, when he had finished eating,
of setting his hands against the table and pushing
himself back from the board with slow and
solid satisfaction. She came to the point where
she longed to scream when he did this. When
they were at table in the main cabin, she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
watched with such agony of trembling nerves
for that movement of his that she forgot to eat,
and could not relish what she ate.
</p>
<p>Joel was a man, and his life was moving
smoothly. His ship&#8217;s casks were filling more
swiftly than he had any right to hope; his wife
was at his side; his skies were clear. He was
happy, and comfortable, and well content.
Sometimes, when they were preparing for sleep,
at night, in the cabin at the stern, he would relax
on the couch there. But she did not wish
for him to put his feet upon the cushions; she
said that his shoes were dirty. He offered to
take off his shoes; and she shuddered....
</p>
<p>He had a fashion of stretching and yawning
comfortably as he bade her good night; and
sometimes a yawn caught him in the middle of a
word, and he talked while he yawned. She
hated this. She was passing through that hard
middle ground, that purgatory between maidenhood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
and wifehood in the course of which married
folk find each other only human, after all.
And she had not yet come to accept this condition,
and to glory in it. She had always
thought of Joel as a hero, a protector, a fine,
stalwart, able, noble man. Now she forgot
that he was commander of this ship and master
of the men aboard her, and saw in him only a
man who, when work was done, liked to take his
ease&mdash;and who talked through his yawns.
</p>
<p>She gnawed at this bone of discontent, in the
hours when Joel was busy with his work. She
was furiously resentful of Joel&#8217;s flesh-and-bloodness....
And Joel, because he was too
busy to be introspective, continued calmly
happy and content.
</p>
<p>The whales led them past Easter Island for
a space; and then, abruptly, they were gone.
Came day on day when the men at the masthead
saw no misty spout against the wide blue
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
of the sea, no glistening black body lying awash
among the waves. And the Nathan Ross, with
all hands scrubbing white the decks again, bent
northward, working toward that maze of tiny
islands which dots the wide South Seas.
</p>
<p>Their water was getting stale, and running
somewhat low; and they needed fresh foodstuffs.
Joel planned to touch at the first land
that offered. Tubuai, that would be. He
marked their progress on the chart.
</p>
<p>On the evening before they would reach the
island, when Joel and Priss were preparing for
sleep, Priss burst out furiously, like a teapot
that boils over. The storm came without warning,
and&mdash;so far as Joel could see&mdash;without
provocation. She was sick, she said, of the
endless wastes of blue. She wanted to see land.
To step on it. If she were not allowed to do so
very soon, she would die.
</p>
<p>Joel, at first, was minded to tell her they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
would sight land in the morning; then, with one
of the blundering impulses to which husbands
fall victim at such moments, he decided to wait
and surprise her. So, instead of telling her, he
chuckled as though at some secret jest, and tried
to quiet her by patting her dark head.
</p>
<p>She fell silent at his caress; and Joel thought
she was appeased. As a matter of fact, she was
hating him for having laughed at her; and her
calm was ferocious. He discovered this, too
late....
</p>
<p>He had just kissed her good night. She
turned her cheek to his lips; and he was faintly
hurt at this. But he only said cheerfully:
&#8220;There, Priss.... You&#8217;ll be all right in the
morning....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He yawned in mid-sentence, so that the last
two or three words sounded as though he were
trying to swallow a large and hot potato while
he uttered them. Priss could stand no more of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
that. Positively. So she slapped his face.
</p>
<p>He was amazed; and he stood, looking at her
helplessly, while the slapped cheek grew red and
red. Priss burst into tears, stamped her foot,
called him names she did not mean, and as a
climax, darted into her own cabin, and swung
the door, and snapped the latch.
</p>
<p>Joel did not in the least understand; and he
went to his bunk at last, profoundly troubled.
</p>
<p>An hour after they anchored, the next day, at
Tubuai, a boat came out from shore and ran
alongside, and Mark Shore swung across the
rail, aboard the <i>Nathan Ross</i>.
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
<h2>VI</h2>
</div>

<p>Joel was below, in the cabin with Priss,
when his brother boarded the ship. Varde
and Dick Morrell had gone ashore for water
and supplies, and Priss was to go that afternoon,
with Joel. She was sewing a ribbon rosette
upon the hat she would wear, when she and
Joel heard the sound of excited voices, and the
movement of feet on the deck above their head.
He left her, curled up on the cushioned bench,
with the gay ribbon in her hands, and went out
through the main cabin, and up the companion.
He had been trying, clumsily enough, to make
friends with Priss; but she was very much on
her dignity that morning....
</p>
<p>When his head rose above the level of the
cabin skylight, he saw a group of men near the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
rail, amidships. Finch, and Hooper, and old
Aaron Burnham, and two of the harpooners, all
pressing close about another man.... Finch
obscured this other man from Joel&#8217;s view, until
he climbed up on deck. Then he saw that the
other man was his brother.
</p>
<p>He went forward to join them; and it
chanced that at first no one of them looked in
his direction. Mark&#8217;s back was half-turned;
but Joel could see that his brother was lean, and
bronzed by the sun. And he wore no hat, and
his thick, black hair was rumpled and wild.
The white shirt that he wore was open at the
throat above his brown neck. His arms were
bare to the elbows. His chest was like a barrel.
There was a splendor of strength and
vigor about the man, in the very look of him,
and in his eye, and his voice, and his laughter.
He seemed to shine, like the sun....
</p>
<p>Joel, as he came near them, heard Mark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
laugh throatily at something Finch had said;
and he heard Finch say unctuously: &#8220;Be sure,
Captain Shore, every man aboard here is
damned glad you&#8217;ve come back to us. You
were missed, missed sore, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed again, at that; and he clapped
Jim&#8217;s fat shoulder. The action swung him
around so that he saw Joel for the first time.
Joel thrust out his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark, man! They said you were dead,&#8221;
he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>Mark Shore&#8217;s eyes narrowed for an instant,
in a quick, appraising scrutiny of his brother.
&#8220;Dead?&#8221; he laughed, jeeringly. &#8220;Do I look
dead?&#8221; He stared at Joel more closely,
glanced at the other men, and chuckled. &#8220;By
the Lord, kid,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I believe old Asa has
put you in my shoes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel nodded. &#8220;He gave me command of the
<i>Nathan Ross</i>. Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>Mark looked sidewise at big Jim Finch, and
grinned. &#8220;Over your head, eh, Jim? Too
damned bad!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finch grinned. &#8220;I had no wish for the place,
sir. You see, I felt very sure you would be
coming back to your own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark tilted back his head and laughed.
&#8220;You were always a very cautious man, Jim
Finch. Never jumped till you were sure where
you would land.&#8221; He wheeled on Joel.
&#8220;Well, boy&mdash;how does it feel to wear long
pants?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel, holding his anger in check, said slowly:
&#8220;We&#8217;ve done well. Close on eight hundred
barrel aboard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark wagged his head in solemn reproof.
&#8220;Joey, Joey, you&#8217;ve been fiddling away your
time. I can see that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Over his brother&#8217;s shoulder, Joel saw the
grinning face of big Jim Finch, and his eyes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
hardened. He said quietly: &#8220;If that&#8217;s your
tone, Mark, you&#8217;ll call back your boat and go
ashore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A flame surged across Mark&#8217;s cheek; and he
took one swift, terrible step toward his brother.
But Joel did not give ground; and after a moment
in which their eyes clashed like swords,
Mark relaxed, and laughed and bowed low.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wrong, grievously wrong, Captain
Shore,&#8221; he said sonorously. &#8220;I neglected the
respect due your office. Your high office, sir.
I thank you for reminding me of the&mdash;the proprieties,
Captain.&#8221; And he added, in a different
tone, &#8220;Now will you not invite me aft on
your ship, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel hesitated for a bare instant, caught by a
vague foreboding that he could not explain.
But in the end he nodded, as though in answer
to the unspoken question in his thoughts.
&#8220;Will you come down into the cabin, Mark?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
he invited quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve much to ask you;
and you must have many things to tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark nodded. &#8220;I will come,&#8221; he said; and
his eyes lighted suddenly, and he dropped a
hand on Joel&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Aye, Joel,&#8221; he said
softly, into his brother&#8217;s ear, as they went aft
together. &#8220;Aye, I&#8217;ve much to tell. Many
things and marvelous. Matters you&#8217;d scarce
credit, Joel.&#8221; Joel looked at him quickly, and
Mark nodded. &#8220;True they are, Joel,&#8221; he cried
exultantly. &#8220;Marvelous&mdash;and true as good,
red gold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the tone, and the eager light in his brother&#8217;s
eyes, Joel&#8217;s slow pulses quickened, but he
said nothing. At the top of the cabin companion,
he stepped aside to let Mark descend first;
and Mark went down the steep and awkward
stair with the easy, sliding gait of a great cat.
Joel, behind him, could see the muscles stir and
swell upon his shoulders. In the cabin, Mark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
halted abruptly, and looked about, and exclaimed:
&#8220;You&#8217;ve changed things, Joel. I&#8217;d
not know the ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door into Priscilla&#8217;s cabin, across the
stern, was open. Priss had finished that matter
of the ribbon, and was watering her flowers,
kneeling on the bench, when she heard Mark&#8217;s
voice, and knew it. And she cried, in surprise
and joy: &#8220;Mark! Oh&mdash;Mark!&#8221; And she
ran to the door, and stood there, framed for
Mark&#8217;s eyes against the light behind her, hands
holding to the door frame on either side.
</p>
<p>Mark cried delightedly: &#8220;Priss Holt!&#8221;
And he was at her side in an instant, and caught
her without ceremony, and kissed her roundly,
as he had been accustomed to do when he came
home from the sea. But he must have been a
blind man not to have seen in that first moment
that Priss was no longer child, but woman.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
And Mark was not blind. He kissed her till
she laughingly fought herself free.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark!&#8221; she cried again. &#8220;You&#8217;re not dead.
I knew you couldn&#8217;t be....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel, behind them, at sight of Priscilla in his
brother&#8217;s arms, had stirred with a quick rush of
anger; but he was ashamed of it in the next moment,
and stood still where he was. Mark held
Priss by the shoulders, laughing down at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how did you know I couldn&#8217;t be dead?&#8221;
he demanded. &#8220;Miss Wise Lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She moved her head confusedly. &#8220;Oh&mdash;you
were always so&mdash;so alive, or something....
You just couldn&#8217;t be....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He chuckled, released her, and stood away
and surveyed her. &#8220;Priss, Priss,&#8221; he said contritely,
&#8220;you&#8217;re not a little kid any longer.
Dresses down, and hair up....&#8221; He wagged
his head. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you did not slap my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
face.&#8221; And then he looked from her to Joel,
and abruptly he tossed his great head back and
laughed aloud. &#8220;By the Lord,&#8221; he roared.
&#8220;The children are married. Married....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priscilla flushed furiously, and stamped her
foot at him. &#8220;Of course we&#8217;re married,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;Did you think I&#8217;d come clear around
the world with....&#8221; Her words were smothered
in her own hot blushes, and Mark laughed
again, until she cried: &#8220;Stop it. I won&#8217;t have
you laughing at us. Joel&mdash;make him stop!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark sobered instantly, and he backed away
from Joel in mock panic, both hands raised, defensively,
so that they laughed at him. When
they laughed, he cast aside his panic, and sat
down on the cushions, stretching his legs luxuriously
before him. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Tell me all about it. When, and why, and
how?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priss dropped on the bench beside him, feet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
tucked under her in the miraculous fashion of
small women; and she enumerated her answers
on the pink tips of her fingers. &#8220;When?&#8221; she
repeated. &#8220;The day before we sailed. Why?
Just because. How? In the same old way.&#8221;
She waved her hand, as though disposing of the
matter once and for all, and looked up at him,
and laughed. Joel thought she had not seemed
so completely happy since the day the cabin was
finished. &#8220;So,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that&#8217;s all there is to
tell you about us. Tell us about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;Ah, now, what&#8217;s the
use? That will come later. Besides&mdash;some
chapters are not for gentle ears.&#8221; He nodded
toward Joel. &#8220;So you love the boy, yonder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priss bobbed her head, red lips pursed, eyes
dancing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Mark demanded. &#8220;What do you
discover in him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked at Joel, and they laughed together
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
as though at some delightful secret, mutually
shared. Mark wagged his head dolorously.
&#8220;And I suppose he&#8217;s wild about you?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>She nodded more vigorously than ever.
</p>
<p>Mark rubbed his hands together. He looked
at Joel, with a faintly malicious twinkle in his
eyes. &#8220;Well, now!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;That is
certainly the best of news....&#8221; Joel saw the
mocking and malignant little devil in his eye.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had a kid sister,&#8221; said Mark gayly.
&#8220;And it&#8217;s been the great sorrow of my life,
Priss. So, Joel, you must expect Priss and
myself to turn out the very best of friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Priscilla, on the seat beside him, nodded
her lovely head once more. &#8220;I should say so,&#8221;
she exclaimed.

<h2>VII</h2>
</div>

<p>Mark Shore held something like a reception,
on the <i>Nathan Ross</i>, all that
first day. He went forward among the men
to greet old friends and meet new ones, and
came back and complimented Joel on the quality
of his crew. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made good men of
them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those that weren&#8217;t good men
before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He listened, with a smile half contemptuous,
to Jim Finch&#8217;s somewhat slavish phrases of welcome
and admiration; and he talked with
Varde, the morose second mate, so gayly that
even Varde was cozened at last into a grin.
Old Hooper was pathetically glad to see him.
Hooper had been mate of the ship on which
Mark started out as a boy; and he liked to hark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
back to those days. Young Dick Morrell, on
his trips from the shore, gave Mark frank worship.
</p>
<p>Joel saw all this. He could not help seeing
it. And he told himself, again and again, that
it was only to be expected. Mark had captained
this ship, had captained these men, on
their last cruise; they had thought him dead.
It was only natural that they should welcome
him back to life again....
</p>
<p>But even while he gave himself this reassurance,
he knew that it was untrue. There
was more than mere welcome in the attitude of
the men; there was more than admiration.
There was a quality of awe that was akin to
worship; and there was, beneath this awe, a
lively curiosity as to what Mark would do....
They knew him for a quick man, dominant, one
with the will to lead; and now he found himself
supplanted, dependent on the word of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
own younger brother.... Every one knew
that Mark and Joel had always been rather enemies
than comrades; so, now, they wondered,
and waited, and watched with all their eyes.
Joel saw them, by twos and threes, whispering
together about the ship; and he knew what it
was they were asking each other.
</p>
<p>Of all those on the <i>Nathan Ross</i> that day,
Mark himself seemed least conscious of the dramatic
possibilities of the situation. He was
glad to be back among friends; but beyond that
he did not go. He gave Joel an exaggerated
measure of respect, so extreme that it was worse
than scorn or mockery. Otherwise, he took no
notice of the potentialities created by his return.
</p>
<p>Priss had planned to go ashore in the afternoon;
but Mark dissuaded her. This was not
difficult; he did it so laughingly and so dextrously
that Priss changed her mind without
knowing just why she did so. Mark took it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
upon himself to make up for her disappointment;
they were together most of the long, hot
afternoon. Joel could hear their laughter now
and then.
</p>
<p>He had expected to go ashore with Priss; but
when she came to him and said: &#8220;Joel, Mark
says it&#8217;s just dirty and hot and ugly, ashore, and
I&#8217;m not going,&#8221; he changed his mind. There
was no need of his making the trip, after all.
Varde and Morrell had brought out water, towing
long strings of almost-filled casks behind
their boats; and boats from the shore had come
off to sell fresh food. So at dusk, the anchor
came up, and the <i>Nathan Ross</i> spread her dingy
sails, and stalked out of the harbor with the utmost
dignity in every stiff line of her, and the
night behind them swallowed up the island.
Mark and Priss were astern to watch it blend in
the darkness and lose itself; and Priss, when
their last glimpse of it faded, heard the man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
draw a deep breath of something like relief.
She looked up at him with wide, curious eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked softly. &#8220;Were you&mdash;unhappy
there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed aloud. &#8220;My dear Priss,&#8221; he
said, in the elder-brother manner he affected toward
her. &#8220;My dear Priss, the South Sea Islands
are no place for a white man, especially
when he is alone. I&#8217;m glad to get back in the
smell of oil, with an honest deck underfoot.
And I don&#8217;t mind saying so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priss shuddered, and wrinkled her nose.
&#8220;Ugh, how I hate that smell,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;But, Mark&mdash;tell me where you&#8217;ve been, and
what you did, and&mdash;everything. Why won&#8217;t
you tell?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He wagged his head at her severely. &#8220;Children,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;should be seen and not heard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stamped her foot. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a child.
I&#8217;m a woman.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>He bent toward her suddenly, his dark eyes
so close to hers that she could see the flickering
flame which played in them, and the twist of his
smile. &#8220;I wonder!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Oh&mdash;I
wonder if you are....&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was frightened, deliciously....
</p>
<p>Mark had persisted, all day long, in his refusal
to tell her of himself. He had dropped a
sentence now and then that brought to life in
her imagination a strange, wild picture....
But always he set a bar upon his lips, caught
back the words, refused to explain what it was
he had meant to say. When she persisted, he
laughed at her and told her he only did it to be
mysterious. &#8220;Mystery is always interesting,
you understand,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;And&mdash;I wish
to be very interesting to you, Priss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked around the after deck for Joel;
but he was below in the cabin, and she decided,
abruptly, that she must go down....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>They had bought chickens at Tubuai, and
they had two of them, boiled, for supper that
night in the cabin. It was a feast, after the
long months of sober diet; and the presence of
Mark made it something more. He was a good
talker, and without revealing anything of the
months of his disappearance, he nevertheless
told them stories that held each one breathless
with interest. But after supper, he went on
deck with Finch, and Joel and Priss sat in the
cabin astern for a while; and Joel wrote up, in
the ship&#8217;s log, the story of his brother&#8217;s return.
Priss read it over his shoulder, and afterwards
she clung close to Joel. &#8220;He&#8217;s a terribly&mdash;overwhelming
man, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>Joel looked down at her, and smiled thoughtfully.
&#8220;Aye, Mark&#8217;s a big man,&#8221; he agreed.
&#8220;Big&mdash;in many ways. But&mdash;you&#8217;ll be used to
him presently, Priss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When she prepared to go to bed, he bade her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
good night and left her, and went on deck; and
Priss, in her narrow bunk in the cabin at the side
of the ship, lay wide-eyed with many thoughts
stirring in her small head. She was still awake
when she heard them come down into the main
cabin together, Joel and Mark. The walls
were thin; she could hear their words, and she
heard Mark ask: &#8220;Sure Priss is asleep?
There are parts&mdash;not for the pretty ears of a
bride, Joel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priss was not asleep, but when Joel came to
see, she closed her eyes, and lay as still as still,
scarce breathing. Joel bent over her softly;
and he touched her head, clumsily, with his
hand, and patted it, and went away again, closing
her door behind him. She heard him tell
Mark: &#8220;Aye, she&#8217;s fast asleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The brothers sat by Joel&#8217;s desk, in the cabin
across the stern; and Mark, without preamble,
told his story there. Priss, ten feet away, heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
every word; and she lay huddled beneath the
blankets, eyes staring upward into the darkness
of her cabin; and as she listened, she shuddered
and trembled and shrank at the terror and wonder
and ugliness of the tale he told. No Desdemona
ever listened with such half-caught
breath....
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
<h2>VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re blaming me,&#8221; said Mark, when
he and Joel were puffing at their pipes,
&#8220;for leaving my ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said slowly: &#8220;No. But I do not understand
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed, a soft and throaty laugh.
&#8220;You would not, Joel. You would not. For
you never felt an overwhelming notion that you
must dance in the moon upon the sand.
You&#8217;ve never felt that, Joel; and&mdash;I have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a hand for dancing,&#8221; said Joel.
</p>
<p>Mark seemed to forget that his brother sat
beside him. His eyes became misty and
thoughtful, as though he were living over again
the days of which he spoke. &#8220;Mind, Joel,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;there&#8217;s a pagan in every man of us. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
there&#8217;s two pagans in some of us. And I&#8217;m
minded, Joel, that there are three of them in
me. &#8217;Twas so, that night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was night when you left the ship?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, night. Night, and the moon; and it
may have been that I had been drinking a drop
or two. Also, as you shall see, I was not well.
I tell these things, not by way of excuse and
palliation; but only so that you may understand.
D&#8217;ye see? I was three pagans in one
body, and that body witched by moon, and
twisted by drink, and trembling with fever.
And so it was I went ashore, and flung my men
behind me, and went off, dancing, along the
hard sand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a night, Joel. A slow-winded,
warm, trembling night when there was a song in
the very air. The wind tingled on your throat
like a woman&#8217;s finger tips; and the sea was singing
at the one side, and the wind in the palms on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
the other. And ahead of me, the wild, discordant
chanting of the Islanders about their fires....
That singing it was that got me by the
throat, and led me. I twirled around and
around, very solemnly, by myself in the moonlight
on the sand; and all the time I went onward
toward the fires....
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember, when I came in sight of the
fires, I threw away my coat and ran in among
them. And they scattered, and yelled their
harsh, meaningless, throaty yells. And they
hid in the bush to stare at me by the fire....
They hid in the rank, thick grasses. All except
one, Joel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel, listening, watched his brother and saw
through his brother&#8217;s eyes; for he knew, for all
his slow blood, the witchery of those warm,
southern nights.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The moon was on her,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;The
moon was on her, and there was a red blossom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
in her hair, and some strings of things that
clothed her. A little brown girl, with eyes like
the eyes of a deer. And&mdash;not afraid of me.
That was the thing that got me, Joel. She
stood in my path, met me, watched me; and
her eyes were not afraid....
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was very little. She was only a child.
I suppose we would call her sixteen or seventeen
years old. But they ripen quickly, Joel&mdash;these
Island children. Her little shoulders were as
smooth and soft.... You could not even mark
the ridge of her collar bones, she was fleshed so
sweetly. She stood, and watched me; and the
others crept out of the grasses, at last, and stood
about us. And then this little brown girl held
up her hand to me, and pointed me out to the
others, and said something. I did not know
what it was that she said; but I know now.
She said that I was sick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know then that I was sick. When
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
she lifted her hand to me, I caught it; and I began
to lead her in a wild dance, in the moonlight,
about their dying fires. I could see them,
in the shadows, their eyeballs shining as they
watched us.... And they seemed, after a little,
to move about in a misty, inhuman fashion;
and they twisted into strange, cloud-like shapes.
And I stopped to laugh at them, and my head
dropped down before I could catch it and struck
against the earth, and the earth forsook me,
Joel, and left me swimming in nothing at
all....
</p>
<p>&#8220;My memory was a long time in coming back
to me, Joel. It would peep out at me like a
timid child, hiding among the trees. I would
see it for an instant; then &#8217;twould be gone.
But I know it must have been many days that I
was on the island there. And I knew, after
a time, that I was most extremely sick; and the
little brown girl put cool leaves on my head,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
and gave me strange brews to drink, and rubbed
and patted my chest and my body with her
hands in a fashion that was immensely comfortable
and strengthening. And I twisted on a
bed of coarse grass.... And I remember singing,
at times....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked toward Joel, eyes suddenly flaming.
&#8220;Eh, Joel, I tell you I was not three
pagans, but six, in those days. The thing&#8217;s
clear beyond your guessing, Joel. But it was
big. An immense thing. I was back at the beginning
of the world, with food, and drink, and
my woman.... It was big, I tell you. Big!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His eyes clouded&mdash;he fell silent, and so at
last went on again. &#8220;I was asleep one night,
tossing in my sleep. And something woke me.
And I laid my hand on the spot beside me where
the little brown girl used to lie, and she was
gone. So I got up, unsteadily. There were
rifles snapping in the night; and there were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
screams. And I heard a white man&#8217;s black
curse; and the slap of a blow of flesh on flesh.
And the screams.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I went that way; and the sounds retreated
before me, until I came out, unsteadily,
upon the open beach. There was no moon, that
night; and the water of the lagoon was shot
with fire. And there was a boat, pulling away
from the beach, with screaming in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I swam after the boat for a long time, for I
thought I had heard the voice of the little brown
girl. The water was full of fire. When I
lifted my arms, the fire ran down them in
streams and drops. And sometimes I forgot
what I was about, and stopped to laugh at these
drops of fire. But in the end, I always swam
on. I remember once I thought the little brown
girl swam beside me, and I tried to throw my
arm about her, and she wrenched away, and she
burned me like a brand. I found, afterwards,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
what that was. My breast and sides were
rasped and raw where a shark&#8217;s rough skin had
scraped them. I&#8217;ve wondered, Joel, why the
beast did not take me....
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he did not; for I bumped at last into
the boat, and climbed into it, and it was empty.
But I saw a rope at the end of it, and I pulled
the rope, and came to the schooner&#8217;s stern, and
climbed aboard her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His voice was ringing, exultantly and
proudly. &#8220;I swung aboard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
I stumbled over fighting bodies on the deck,
astern there. And some one cried out, in the
waist of her; and I knew it was the little brown
girl. So I left those struggling bodies at the
stern, for they were not my concern; and I went
forward to the waist. And I found her there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fat man had her. She was fighting him;
and he did not see me. And I put my fingers
quietly into his neck, from behind; and when he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
no longer kicked back at me, and no longer tore
at my fingers with his, I dropped him over the
side. I saw a fiery streak in the water where I
dropped him. That shark was not so squeamish
as the one I had&mdash;embraced. It may have
been the other was embarrassed at my ways,
Joel. D&#8217;ye think that might have been the
way of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel&#8217;s knuckles were white, where his hand
rested on his knee. Mark saw, and laughed
softly. &#8220;There&#8217;s blood in you, after all, boy,&#8221;
he applauded. &#8220;I&#8217;ve hopes for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said slowly: &#8220;What then? What
then, Mark?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed. &#8220;Well, that was a very
funny thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You see, the other two
men, they were busy, astern, with their own concerns.
And when I had comforted the little
brown girl, and sat down on the deck to laugh
at the folly of it all, she slipped away from me,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
and went aft, and got all their rifles. She
brought them to me. She seemed to expect
things of me. So I, still laughing, for the fever
was on me; I took the rifles and threw them,
all but one, over the side. And I went down
into the cabin, with the little brown girl, and
went to bed; and she sat beside me, with the
rifle, and a lamp hanging above the door....
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that was all that happened, until I
woke one morning and saw her there, and wondered
where I was. And my head was clear
again. She made me understand that the men
had sought to come at me, but had feared the
rifle in her hands....
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we were in the open sea, as I could feel
by the labor of the schooner underfoot. So I
took the rifle in the crook of my arm, and with
the little brown girl at my heel, I went up on
deck. And we made a treaty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He fell silent for a moment, and Joel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
watched him, and waited. And at last, Mark
went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had been more than a month on the island,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The <i>Nathan Ross</i> had gone.
This schooner was a pearler, and they had the
location of a bed of shell. They had been
waiting till another schooner should leave the
place, to leave their own way clear. And when
that time came, they went ashore to get the
brown women for companions on that cruise.
And they made the mistake of picking up my
little brown girl, when she ran out of the hut.
And so brought me down upon them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were two of them left; two whites,
and three black men forward, who were of no
account. And the other two women. These
other two were chattering together, on the deck
astern, when I appeared. They seemed content
enough....
</p>
<p>&#8220;The men were not happy. There was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
large man with slanting eyes. There was Oriental
blood in him. You could see that. He
called himself Quint. But his eyes were Jap,
or Chinese; and he had their calm, blank screen
across his countenance, to hide what may have
been his thoughts. Quint, he called himself.
And he was a big man, and very much of a man
in his own way, Joel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The other was little, and he walked with a
slink and a grin. His name was Fetcher. And
he was oily in his speech.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When they saw me, they studied me for a
considerable time without speech. And I stood
there, with the rifle in my arm, and laughed at
them. And at last, Quint said calmly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You took Farrell.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The fat man?&#8217; I asked him. He nodded.
&#8216;Yes,&#8217; I said. &#8216;He took my girl, and so I
dropped him into the water, and a friend met
him there and hurried him away.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Your girl?&#8217; he echoed, in a nasty way.
&#8216;You&#8217;re that, then?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Am I?&#8217; I asked, and shifted the rifle a
thought to the fore. And his eyes held mine
for a space, and then he shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I see that I was mistaken,&#8217; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Your sight is good,&#8217; I told him. &#8216;Now&mdash;what
is this? Tell me.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me, evenly and without malice.
They had a line on the pearls; there were
enough for three. I was welcome. And at the
end, I nodded my consent. The <i>Nathan Ross</i>
was gone. Furthermore, there were nine pagans
in me now; and the prospect of looting
some still lagoon, in company with these two
rats, had a wild flavor about it that caught me.
My blood was burning; and the sun was hot.
Also, they had liquor aboard her. Liquor, and
loot, and the three women. Pagan, Joel. Pagan!
But wild and red and raw. There&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
glory about such things.... Songs are made
of them.... There was no handshaking; but
we made alliance, and crowded on sail, and
went on our way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped short, laughed, filled his pipe
again, watched Joel. &#8220;You&#8217;re shocked with
me, boy. I can see it,&#8221; he taunted mockingly.
Joel shook his head. &#8220;Will you hear the rest?&#8221;
Mark asked; and Joel nodded. Mark lighted
his pipe, laughed.... His fingers thrummed
on the desk beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were a week on the way,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;And all pagan, every minute of the week.
Days when we fought a storm&mdash;as bad as I&#8217;ve
ever seen, Joel. We fought it, holding to the
ropes with our teeth, bare to the waist, with the
wind scourging us. It tore at us, and lashed at
us.... And we drove the three black men
with knives to their work. And the three
women stayed below, except my little brown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
girl. She came up, now and then, with dry
clothes for me.... And I had to drive her to
shelter....
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when there was not the storm, there
was liquor; and they had cards. We staked
our shares in the catch that was to come....
Hour on hour, dealing, and playing with few
words; and our eyes burned hollow in their sockets,
and Quint&#8217;s thin mouth twisted and writhed
all the time like a worm on a pin. He was a
nervous man, for all his calm. A very nervous
man....
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fifth day, one of the blacks stumbled
in Quint&#8217;s path, on deck. Quint had been losing,
at the cards. He slid a knife from his
sleeve into the man&#8217;s ribs, and tipped the black
over the rail without a word. I was twenty
feet away, and it was done before I could catch
breath. I shouted; and Quint turned and
looked at me, and he smiled.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What is it?&#8217; he asked. &#8216;Have you objections
to present?&#8217; And the smeared blade in
his hand, and the bubbles still rising, overside.
I was afraid of the man, Joel. I tell you I was
afraid. The only time. Fear&#8217;s a pagan joy,
boy. It was like a new drink to me. I nursed
it, eating it. And I shook my head, humble.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No objections,&#8217; I said, to Quint. &#8216;&#8217;Tis
your affair.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That was my thought,&#8217; he agreed, and
passed me, and went astern. I stood aside to
let him pass, and trembled, and laughed for the
joy of my fear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then we came to the lagoon, and the
blacks began to dive. Only the two we had;
and there was no sign of Islanders, ashore.
But the water was shallow, and we worked the
men with knives, and they got pearls. Sometimes
one or two in a day; sometimes a dozen.
Do you know pearls, Joel? They&#8217;re sweet as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
woman&#8217;s skin. I had never seen them, before.
And we all went a little mad over them....
</p>
<p>&#8220;They made Fetcher hysterical. He laughed
too much. They made Quint morose. They
made me tremble....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He wiped his hand across his eyes, as though
the memory wearied him; and he moved his
great shoulders, and looked at Joel, and
laughed. &#8220;But it could not last, in that fashion,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It might have been anything.
It turned out to be the women. I said they
seemed content. They did. But that may be
the way of the blacks. They have a happy
habit of life; they laugh easily....
</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, we found one morning that
Quint&#8217;s girl was gone. She was not on the
schooner; and ashore, we found her tracks in
the sand. She had gone into the trees. And
we beat the island, and we did not find her.
And Quint sweated. All that day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That night, he looked at my little brown
girl, and touched her shoulder. I was across
the deck, the girl coming to me with food. I
said to him: &#8216;No. She&#8217;s mine, Quint.&#8217; And
he looked at me, and I beat him with my eyes.
And as his turned from mine, Fetcher and his
woman came on deck, and Quint tapped
Fetcher, and said to him: &#8216;What will you take
for her?&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetcher laughed at him; and Quint scowled.
And I&mdash;for I was minded to see sport, came
across to them and said: &#8216;Play for her.
Play for her!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetcher was willing; because he had the
blood that gambles anything. Quint was willing,
because he was the better player. They
sat down to the game, in the cabin, after supper.
Poker. Cold hands. Nine of them.
Winner of five to win....
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetcher got two, lost four, got two more. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
was dealing. Card by card, face upward. I
remember those hands. And my little brown
girl, and the other, watching from the corner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The hands on the table grew, card by card.
Fetcher got an ace, Quint a deuce. Fetcher a
queen, Quint a seven. Fetcher a jack, Quint a
six. Fetcher a ten, Quint a ten. Only the
last card to come to each. If Fetcher paired
any card, he would win. His card came first.
It was a seven. He was ace, queen high.
Quint had deuce, six, seven, ten. He had to
get a pair to win....
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Quint&#8217;s hand stir, beneath the table;
and I glimpsed a knife in it. But before I
could speak, or stir, Fetcher dropped his own
hand to his trouser leg, and I knew he kept a
blade there.... So I laughed, and dealt
Quint&#8217;s last card....
</p>
<p>&#8220;A deuce. He had a pair, enough to
win....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He leaned back, laughing grimly; and
Fetcher&#8217;s knife went in beneath the left side of
his jaw, where the jugular lies. Quint looked
surprised, and got up out of his chair and lay
down quietly across the table. I heard the
bubbling of his last breath.... Then Fetcher
laughed, and called his woman, and they took
Quint on deck and tipped him overside. The
knife had been well thrown. Fetcher had
barely moved his wrist.... I was much impressed
with the little man, and told my brown
girl so. But she was frightened, and I comforted
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent again for a time, pressing the
hot ashes in his pipe with his thumb. The
water slapped the broad stern of the ship beneath
them, and Joel&#8217;s pipe was gurgling.
There was no other sound. Little Priss, nails
biting her palms, thought she would stream if
the silence held an instant more....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>But Mark laughed softly, and went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetcher and I worked smoothly together,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The little man was very pleasant
and affable; and I met him half way. The
blacks brought up the shells, and we idled
through the days, and played cards at night.
We divided the take, each day; so our stakes
ran fairly high. But luck has a way of balancing.
On the day when we saw the end in sight,
we were fairly even....
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetcher, and the blacks and I went ashore to
get fruit from the trees there. Plenty of it
everywhere; and we were running short. We
went into the brush together, very pleasantly;
and he fell a little behind. I looked back, and
his knife brushed my neck and quivered in a
tree a yard beyond me. So I went back and
took him in my hands. He had another knife&mdash;the
little man fairly bristled with them. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
it struck a rib, and before he could use it again,
his neck snapped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that I was alone on the schooner, with
the two blacks, and Fetcher&#8217;s woman, and the
little brown girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetcher&#8217;s woman went ashore to find him
and never came back. And I decided it was
time for me to go away from that place. The
pagans were dying in me. I did not like that
quiet little island any more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the next morning, when I looked out
beyond the lagoon, another schooner was coming
in. So I was uncomfortable with Fetcher&#8217;s
pearls, as well as mine, in my pocket. There
are some hard men in these seas, Joel; and I
knew none of them would treasure me above my
pearls. So I planned a story of misfortune, and
I went ashore to hide my pearls under a rock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The blacks had brought me ashore. I went
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
out of their sight to do what I had to do; and
when I came back, after hiding the pearls, I saw
them rowing very swiftly toward the schooner.
And they looked back at me in a fearful way.
I wondered why; and then four black men came
down on me from behind, with knives and clubs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a very hard day, that day. They
hunted me back and forth through the island&mdash;I
had not even a knife with me&mdash;and I met them
here and there, and suffered certain contusions
and bruises and minor cuts. Also, I grew very
tired of killing them. They were wiry, but
they were small, and died easily. So I was
glad, when from a point where they had cornered
me I saw the little brown girl rowing the
big boat toward me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was alone. The blacks were afraid to
come, I thought. But I found afterward that
this was not true. They could not come; for
they had tried to seize the schooner and go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
quickly away from that place, and the little
brown girl had drilled them both. She had a
knack with the rifle....
</p>
<p>&#8220;I waded to meet the boat, and she tossed
me the gun. I held them off for a little, while
we drew away from the shore. But when we
were thirty or forty yards off, I heard rifles from
the other schooner, firing past us at the blacks
in the bush; and the girl stopped rowing. So
I turned around and saw that one of the balls
from the other schooner had struck her in the
back. So I sat there, in the sun, drifting with
the wind, and held her in my arms till she
coughed and died.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I went out to the other schooner and
told them they were bad marksmen. They had
only been passing by, for copra; and the story
I told them was a shocking one. They were
much impressed, and they seemed glad to get
away. But the blacks were still on shore, so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
that I could not go back for the pearls; and I
worked the schooner out by myself, and shaped
a course....
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to Tubuai, alone thus, a day before
you, Joel.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>IX</h2>
</div>

<p>For a long time after Mark&#8217;s story ended,
the two brothers sat still in the cabin,
puffing at their pipes, thinking.... Mark
watched Joel, waiting for the younger man to
speak. And Joel&#8217;s thoughts ranged back, and
picked up the tale in the beginning, and followed
it through once more....
</p>
<p>They were silent for so long that little Priss,
in the cabin, drifted from waking dreams to
dreams in truth. The pictures Mark&#8217;s words
had conjured up merged with troubled phantasies,
and she twisted and cried out softly in her
sleep so that Joel went in at last to be sure she
was not sick. But while he stood beside her,
she passed into quiet and untroubled slumber,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
and he came back and sat down with Mark
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You brought the schooner into Tubuai?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye. Alone. Half a thousand miles.
There&#8217;s a task, Joel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And left it there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark smiled grimly. &#8220;It was known there,&#8221;
he said quietly. &#8220;Also, the three whom I had
found aboard it were known. And they had
friends in Tubuai, who wondered what had
come to them. I was beginning to&mdash;find their
questions troublesome&mdash;when the <i>Nathan Ross</i>
came in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will ask more questions now,&#8221; said
Joel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They must ask them of the schooner; and&mdash;she
does not speak,&#8221; Mark told him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>Joel was troubled and uncertain. &#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;a
black thing,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll not be after me, if that distresses
you,&#8221; Mark promised him. &#8220;Curiosity does
not go to such lengths in these waters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You told no one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed. &#8220;The pearls were&mdash;my own
concern. You&#8217;re the first I&#8217;ve told.&#8221; He
watched his brother. Joel frowned thoughtfully,
shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You plan to go back for them?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You and I,&#8221; said Mark casually. Joel
looked at him in quick surprise; and Mark
laughed. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;You and I.
I am not selfish, Joel. Besides&mdash;there are
plenty for two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel, for an instant, found no word; and
Mark leaned quickly toward him. He tapped
Joel&#8217;s knee. &#8220;We&#8217;ll work up that way,&#8221; he
said quietly. &#8220;When we come to the island,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
you and I go ashore, and get them where
they&#8217;re hid beneath the rock; and we come back
aboard with no one any wiser.... Rich. A
double handful of them, Joel....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel&#8217;s eyes were clouded with thought; he
shook his head slowly. &#8220;What of the blacks?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>Mark laughed. &#8220;They were brought down
on us by the woman who got away,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Quint&#8217;s woman. I heard as much that day,
saw her among them. But&mdash;they&#8217;re gone before
this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said slowly: &#8220;You are not sure of that.
And&mdash;I cannot risk the ship....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark asked sneeringly: &#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The younger man flushed; but he said steadily:
&#8220;Yes. Afraid of losing Asa Worthen&#8217;s
ship for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark chuckled unpleasantly. &#8220;I&#8217;m minded
of what is written, here and there, in the &#8216;Log
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
of the House of Shore,&#8217;&#8221; he said, half to himself.
And he quoted: &#8220;&#8216;All the brothers were
valiant....&#8217; There&#8217;s more to that, Joel.
&#8216;And all the sisters virtuous.&#8217; I had not known
we had sisters&mdash;but it seems you&#8217;re one, boy.
Not valiant, by your own admission; but at
least you&#8217;re fairly virtuous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel paid no heed to the taunt. &#8220;Asa
Worthen likes care taken of his ship,&#8221; he said,
half to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking he would not
think well of this.... He&#8217;s not a man to
gamble....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gamble?&#8221; Mark echoed scornfully. &#8220;He
has no gamble in this. The pearls are for you
and me. He will know nothing whatever
about them. A handful for me, and a handful
for you, Joel. For the taking....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not think to give him owner&#8217;s
lay?&#8221; Joel asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where is this island?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not be too precise&mdash;until
I have your word, Joel. But&mdash;&#8217;tis to the
northward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our course is west, then south.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when has the <i>Nathan Ross</i> kept schedule
and time table like a mail ship?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel shook his head. &#8220;I cannot do it, Mark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A risk I have no right to take; and wasted
weeks, out of our course. For which Asa
Worthen pays.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark smiled sardonically. &#8220;You&#8217;re vastly
more virtuous than any sister could be, Joel,
my dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said steadily: &#8220;There may be two
minds about that. There may be two minds as
to&mdash;the duty of a captain to his ship and his
owner. But&mdash;I&#8217;ve shown you my mind in the
matter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>Mark leaned toward him, eyes half-friendly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, Joel. I&#8217;ll convince you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A handful of them,&#8221; Mark whispered.
&#8220;Worth anything up to a hundred thousand.
Maybe more. I do not know the little things
as well as some. All for a little jog out of your
way....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel shook his head. And Mark, in a sudden
surge of anger, stormed to his feet with
clenched hand upraised. &#8220;By the Lord, Joel,
I&#8217;d not have believed it. You&#8217;re mad; plain
mad&mdash;sister, dear! You....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said quietly: &#8220;Your schooner is at
Tubuai. I&#8217;ll set you back there, if you will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark mocked him. &#8220;Would you throw
your own brother off the ship he captained?...
Oh hard, hard heart....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may stay, or go,&#8221; Joel told him.
&#8220;Have your way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>Mark&#8217;s eyes for an instant narrowed; they
turned toward the door of the cabin where Priss
lay.... And there was a flicker of black hatred
in them, but his voice was suave when he
replied: &#8220;With your permission, captain dear,
I&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel nodded; he rose. &#8220;Young Morrell has
given you his bunk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So&mdash;good
night, to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He opened the door into the main cabin; and
Mark, his fingers twitching, went out. He
turned, spoke over his shoulder. &#8220;Good night;
and&mdash;pleasant dreams,&#8221; he said.
</p>

</div>

<p>Even Joel Shore saw the new light in
Priscilla&#8217;s eyes when she met Mark at
breakfast in the cabin next morning; and it is
said husbands are the last to see such things.
</p>
<p>That story she had heard the night before,
the story Mark told Joel in the after cabin, had
made of him something superhuman in her eyes.
He was a gigantic, an epic figure; he had lived
red life, and fought for his life, and killed....
There was Puritan blood in Priscilla; but overrunning
it was a flood of warmer life, a cross-strain
from some southern forebear, which sang
now in answer to the touch of Mark&#8217;s words.
She watched him, that morning, with wide eyes
that were full of wonder and of awe.
</p>
<p>Mark saw, and was immensely amused. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
asked her: &#8220;Why do you look at me like that,
little sister? I&#8217;m not going to bite....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priscilla caught herself, and smiled, and
laughed at him. &#8220;How do I look at you?
You&#8217;re&mdash;imagining things, Mark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; he asked. And he touched Joel&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;Look at her, Joel, and see which of us
is right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel was eating his breakfast silently, but he
had seen Priscilla&#8217;s eyes. He looked toward
her now, and she flushed in spite of herself,
and got up quickly, and slipped away....
They watched her go, Joel&#8217;s eyes clouded
thoughtfully, Mark&#8217;s shining. And when she
was gone, Mark leaned across and said to Joel
softly, a devil of mischief in his eyes: &#8220;She
heard my tale last night, Joel. She was not
asleep. Fooled you....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel shook his head. &#8220;No. She was
asleep.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>Mark laughed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose I know.
I&#8217;ve seen that look in woman&#8217;s eyes before. In
the eyes of the little brown girl, the night I
dropped the fat man overside....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat there, chuckling, when Joel got abruptly
to his feet and went on deck; and when
he came up the companion a little later, he was
still chuckling under his breath.
</p>
<p>After that first morning, Priss was able to
cloak her eyes and hide her thoughts; and on
the surface, life aboard the <i>Nathan Ross</i> seemed
to go on as before. Mark threw himself into
the routine of the work, mixing with the men,
going off in the boats when there was a whale to
be struck, doing three men&#8217;s share of toil. Joel
one day remonstrated with him. &#8220;It is not
wise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You were captain here; you
are my brother. It is not wise for you to mix,
as an equal, with the men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark only laughed at him. &#8220;Your dignity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
is very precious to you, Joel,&#8221; he mocked.
&#8220;But as for me&mdash;I am not proud. You&#8217;d not
have me sit aft and twiddle my thumbs and
hold yarn for little Priss.... And I must be
doing something....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He and Jim Finch were much together.
Finch always gave Joel careful obedience, always
handled the ship when he was in charge
with smooth efficiency. His boat was the best
manned and the most successful of the four.
But he and Joel were not comradely. Joel instinctively
disliked the big man; and Finch&#8217;s
servility disgusted him. The mate was full of
smooth and flattering words, but his eyes were
shallow.
</p>
<p>Mark talked with him long, one morning;
and then he left Finch and came to Joel, by the
after house, chuckling as though at some enormous
jest. &#8220;Will ye look at Finch, there?&#8221;
he begged.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>Joel had been watching the two. He saw
Finch now, standing just forward of the boat
house with flushed cheeks and eyes fixed and
hands twitching. The big man was powerfully
moved by something.... &#8220;What is it that&#8217;s
got him?&#8221; Joel asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told him about the pearls,&#8221; Mark
chuckled. &#8220;He&#8217;s wild to be after them....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel turned on his brother hotly. &#8220;You&#8217;re
mad, Mark,&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;That is no word to
be loose in the ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve but told Finch,&#8221; Mark protested.
&#8220;It&#8217;s mirthful to watch the man wiggle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll tell the ship. His tongue wags unceasingly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark lifted his shoulders. &#8220;Tell him to be
silent. You should keep order on your ship,
Joel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel beckoned, and Finch came toward them.
As he came, he fought for self control; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
when he stood before them, his lips were twisting
into something like a smile, and his eyes
were shifty and gleaming. Joel said quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Finch, my brother says he has told you
his story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Finch. &#8220;An extraordinary
adventure, Captain Shore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it best the men should know nothing
about it,&#8221; Joel told him. &#8220;You will please
keep it to yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finch grinned. &#8220;Of course, sir. There&#8217;s no
need they should have any share in them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel flushed angrily. &#8220;We are not going
after them. I consider it dangerous, and unwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Over Finch&#8217;s fat cheeks swept a twitching
grimace of dismay. &#8220;But I thought....&#8221;
He looked at Mark, and Mark was chuckling.
&#8220;It&#8217;s so easy, sir,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Just go, and
get them.... Rich....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Joel shook his head. &#8220;Keep silent about the
matter, Finch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finch slowly bowed his head, and he smirked
respectfully. &#8220;Very well, Captain Shore,&#8221; he
agreed. &#8220;You always know best, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned away; and after a little Mark said
softly: &#8220;You have him well trained, Joel.
Like a little dog.... I wonder that you can
handle men so....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two days later, Joel knew that either Finch
or Mark had told the tale anew. Young Dick
Morrell came to him with shining eyes. &#8220;Is it
true, sir, that we&#8217;re going after the pearls your
brother hid?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I just heard....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel gripped the boy&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Who told
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morrell twisted free, half angry. &#8220;I&mdash;overheard
it, sir. Is it true?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Joel. &#8220;We&#8217;re a whaler, and we
stick to our trade.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>Dick lifted both hands, in a gesture almost
pleading. &#8220;But it would be so simple,
sir....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep the whole matter quiet, Morrell,&#8221; Joel
told him. &#8220;I do not wish the men to know of
it. And if you hear any further talk, report it
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morrell&#8217;s eyes were sulky. He said slowly:
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; The set of his shoulders, as he
stalked forward, seemed to Joel defiant....
</p>
<p>Within the week, the whole ship knew the
story. Old Aaron Burnham, repairing a bunk
in the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le, heard the men whispering the
thing among themselves. &#8220;Tongues hissing
like little serpents, sir,&#8221; he told Joel, in the
cabin that night. &#8220;All of pearls, and women,
and the like.... And a shine in their
eyes....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Aaron,&#8221; Joel said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry the
men know....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, they know. Be sure of that,&#8221; Aaron
repeated, with bobbing head. &#8220;And they&#8217;re
roused by what they know. Some say you&#8217;re
going after the pearls, and aim to fraud them of
their lay. And some say you&#8217;re a mad fool that
will not go....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel&#8217;s fist, on the table, softly clenched.
&#8220;What else?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Aaron watched him sidewise. &#8220;There was a
whisper that you might be made to go....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priscilla saw, that night, that Joel was troubled.
She and Mark were together on the cushioned
seat in the after cabin, and Joel sat at his
desk, over the log. Mark was telling Priss an
expurgated version of some one of his adventures;
and Joel, looking once or twice that way,
saw the quick-caught breath in her throat,
saw her tremulous interest.... And his eyes
clouded, so that when Priscilla chanced to look
toward him, she saw, and cried:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Joel! What&#8217;s the matter? You look
so....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked from one of them to the other for
a space; and then his eyes rested on Mark&#8217;s, and
he said slowly: &#8220;It&#8217;s in my mind that I&#8217;d have
done best to set you ashore at Tubuai, Mark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed; but Priss cried hotly:
&#8220;Joel! What a perfectly horrible thing to
say!&#8221; Her voice had grown deeper and more
resonant of late, Joel thought. It was no
longer the voice of a girl, but of a woman....
Mark touched her arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care about him,&#8221; he told her.
&#8220;That&#8217;s only brotherly love....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He oughtn&#8217;t to say it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said quietly: &#8220;This is a matter you do
not understand, Priscilla. You would do well
to keep silent. It is my affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A month before, this would have swept Priss
into a fury of anger; but this night, though her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
eyes burned with slow resentment, she bit her
lips and was still. A month ago, she would
have forgotten over night. Now she would remember....
</p>
<p>Mark got up, laughed. &#8220;He&#8217;s bad company,
Priss,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;Come on deck with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She rose, readily enough; and they went out
through the main cabin, and up the companionway.
Joel watched them go. They left open
the door into the cabin, and he heard Varde and
Finch, at the table there, talking in husky whispers.... It
was so, he knew, over the whole
ship. Everywhere, the men were whispering.... There
hung over the <i>Nathan Ross</i> a cloud
as definite as a man&#8217;s hand; and every man
scowled&mdash;save Mark Shore. Mark smiled
with malicious delight at the gathering storm he
had provoked....
</p>
<p>Joel, left in the after cabin, felt terribly
lonely. He wanted Priss with him, laughing,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
at his side. His longing for her was like a hot
coal in his throat, burning there. And she had
taken sides with Mark, against him.... His
shoulders shook with the sudden surge of his
desire to grip Mark&#8217;s lean throat.... Ashore,
he would have done so. But as things were,
the ship was his first charge; and a break with
Mark would precipitate the thing that menaced
the ship.... He could not fight Mark without
risking the <i>Nathan Ross</i>; and he could not
risk the <i>Nathan Ross</i>. Not even.... His
head dropped for an instant in his arms, and
then he got up quickly, and shook himself, and
set his lips.... No man aboard must see the
trouble in his heart....
</p>
<p>He went through the main cabin, and
climbed to the deck. There was some sea running,
and a wind that brushed aside all smaller
sounds, so that he made little noise. Thus,
when he reached the top of the companion, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
saw two dark figures in the shadows of the boat
house, closely clasped....
</p>
<p>He stood for an instant, white hot.... His
wife, and Mark.... His little Priss, and his
brother....
</p>
<p>Then he went quietly below, and glanced
at the chart, and chose a course upon it.
The nearest land; he and Mark ashore together....
His blood ran hungrily at the
thought....
</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
</div>

<p>Priscilla went on deck that night so
angry with Joel that she could have
killed him; and Mark played upon her as a
skilled hand plays upon the harp. It was such
a night as the South Seas know, warm and languorous,
the wind caressing, and the salt spray
stinging gently on the cheek. The moon was
near the full, and it laid a path of silver on the
water. This path was like the road to fairyland;
and Mark told Priscilla so. He dropped
into a gay little phantasy that he conceived on
the moment, a story of fairies, and of dancing
in the moonlight, and of a man and a woman,
hand in hand....
</p>
<p>She felt the spell he laid upon her, and struggled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
against it. &#8220;Tell me about the last fight,
when the little brown girl was killed,&#8221; she
begged.
</p>
<p>He had told her snatches of his story here
and there; but he had not, till that night, spoken
of the pearls. When Priss heard of them, she
swung about and lifted up her face to his, listening
like a child. And Mark told the story with
a tongue of gold, so that she saw it all; the lagoon,
blue in the sun; and the schooner creeping
in from the sea; and the hours of flight through
the semi-jungle of the island, with the blacks in
such hot pursuit. He told her of the times
when they surrounded him, when he fought
himself free.... How he got a great stone
and gripped it in his hand, and how with this
stone he crushed the skull of a young black with
but one eye. Priss shuddered with delicious
horror at the tale....
</p>
<p>She loved best to hear of the little brown girl
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
whom Mark had loved; and that would have
told either of them, if they had stopped to consider,
that she did not love Mark. Else she
would have hated the other, brown or white....
And he told how the brown girl saved
him, and gave her life in the saving, and how
he had stopped at a little atoll on his homeward
way and buried her.... She had died in his
arms, smiling because she lay there....
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the pearls?&#8221; Priss asked, when she had
heard the story through. &#8220;You left them
there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There they are still,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;Safely
hid away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Are they
lovely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three big ones, and thirty-two of a fair
size, and enough little ones and seeds to make a
double handful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why did you leave them there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The black men were on the island. They
were there, and watchful, and very angry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you have kept them in your
pocket?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;That other schooner made me
cautious. Man&#8217;s life is cheap, in such matters.
And if they guessed I had such things upon me....
If I slept too soundly, or the like....
D&#8217;ye see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She nodded her dark head. &#8220;I see. But
you&#8217;ll go back....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He chuckled at that, and tapped on the rail
with one knuckle, in a thoughtful way. &#8220;I had
thought that Joel and I would go, in the
<i>Nathan Ross</i>, and fetch the things away,&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;That would
be so easy.... I&#8217;d love to see the&mdash;pearls....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy? That was my own thought,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
agreed. Something in his tone prompted her
question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joel objects,&#8221; he said drily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&mdash;won&#8217;t. But why? I don&#8217;t understand.
Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed. &#8220;He speaks of a matter of
duty, not to risk the ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a risk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; He chuckled maliciously. &#8220;As a
matter of cold fact, Priss, I&#8217;m fearful that Joel
is a bit&mdash;timid in such affairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She flamed at him: &#8220;Afraid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His eyes shone. &#8220;What a loyal little bride?
But&mdash;I taxed him with it. And&mdash;that was the
word he used....&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was so angry that she beat upon Mark&#8217;s
great breast with her tiny fists. &#8220;It&#8217;s not true!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
It&#8217;s not true!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You know....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Abruptly, Mark took fire. She was swept in
his arms, clipped there, half-lifted from the
deck to meet his lips that dipped to hers. She
was like nothing in his grasp; she could not
stir.... And from his lips, and circling arms,
and great body the hot fire of the man flung
through her.... She fought him.... But
even in that terrific moment she knew that Joel
had never swept or whelmed her so....
</p>
<p>She twisted her face away.... And thus,
from the shadow where they stood, she saw Joel.
He was at the top of the cabin companion, looking
toward them, his face illumined by the light
from below. And she watched for an instant,
frozen with terror, expecting him to leap toward
them and plunge at Mark and buffet him....
</p>
<p>Joel stood for an instant, unstirring. Then
he turned, very quietly, and went down stairs
again into the cabin....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>She thought, sickly, that he had shirked; he
had seen, and held his hand....
</p>
<p>What was it Mark had said? Afraid....
</p>
<p>Mark had not seen Joel. He kissed her
again. Then she twisted away from him, and
fled below.
</p>
<p>Joel was at his desk. He did not look up at
her coming; and she stood for an instant, behind
him, watching his bent head....
</p>
<p>Then she slipped into her own cabin, and
snapped the latch, and plunged her face in her
pillow to stifle bursting sobs.
</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
</div>

<p>The <i>Nathan Ross</i> changed course that
day; and the word went around the ship.
It passed from man to man. There was whispering;
and there were dark looks, flung toward
Joel.
</p>
<p>Joel kept the deck all day, silent, and watchful,
and waiting. Mark spoke to him once or
twice, asking what he meant to do. Joel told
him nothing. He had fought out his fight the
night before; he knew himself....
</p>
<p>Mark and Finch talked together, during the
morning. Joel watched them without comment.
Later he saw Mark speak to the other
mates, one by one. At dinner in the cabin, the
mates were silent. Their eyes had something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
of shame in them, and something of venomous
hate.... They already hated Joel, whom
they planned to wrong....
</p>
<p>The day was fair, and the wind drove them
smoothly. There was no work to be done,
never a spout on the sea. Joel, watching once
or twice the whispering groups of idle men,
wished a whale might be sighted; and once he
sent Morrell and Varde to find tasks for the
men to do, and kept them at it through the long
afternoon, scraping, scrubbing, painting....
</p>
<p>Priss kept to her cabin. When she did not
appear at breakfast, Joel went to her door and
knocked. She called to him: &#8220;I&#8217;ve a headache.
I&#8217;m going to rest.&#8221; He ordered that
food be sent to her....
</p>
<p>He stayed on deck till late, that night; but
with the coming of night the ship had grown
quiet, and most of the men were below in the
fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le. So at last Joel left the deck to Varde,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
and went below. He sat down at his desk and
wrote up the day&#8217;s log....
</p>
<p>Priss came to him there. She had been in
bed; and she wore a heavy dressing gown over
her night garments. Her hair was braided,
hanging across her shoulders. She sat down
beside the desk, and when Joel could fight back
the misery in his eyes, he looked toward her
and asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your head&mdash;better?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She said very quietly: &#8220;Joel, I want to
ask you something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He wanted her sympathy so terribly, and her
tone was so cool and so aloof that he winced;
but he said: &#8220;Very well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark says he asked you to take the <i>Nathan
Ross</i> to get&mdash;the pearls he left on that island.
Is that true?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Joel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He says you would not do it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will not do it,&#8221; Joel told her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He says,&#8221; said Priss quietly, &#8220;that you are
afraid. He says that was your own word ...
when he accused you. Is that true?&#8221;
</p>
<p>If there had been any sympathy or understanding
in her voice or in her eyes, he would
have told her ... told her that it was for his
ship and not for himself that he was afraid.
But there was not. She was so cold and hard....
He would not seek to justify himself to
her....
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I used that word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned her eyes quickly away from his,
that he might not see the pain in hers.... She
rose to go back to her cabin....
</p>
<p>As she reached the door, some one knocked on
the door that led to the main cabin; and without
waiting for word from Joel, that door
opened. Mark stood there. He came in, with
Finch, and Varde, and old Hooper and young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Morrell on his heels.... Priss shrank back
into her cabin, closed the door to a crack, listened....
</p>
<p>Joel got to his feet. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>Mark bowed low, faced his brother with a
cold and triumphant smile. &#8220;These gentlemen
have asked me,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;to tell you that
we have decided to go fetch the pearls.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
<h2>XIII</h2>
</div>

<p>When Priss, through the crack in the
door, heard what Mark had said, she
shut the door of her cabin soundlessly, and
crouched against it, listening. She was trembling....
</p>
<p>There was a long moment when no one of the
men in the after cabin spoke. Then big Jim
Finch said suavely: &#8220;That is to say, if Captain
Shore does not object.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel asked then: &#8220;What if I do object?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed. &#8220;If you do object, why&mdash;we&#8217;ll
just go anyway. But you&#8217;ll have no
share.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And surly Varde added: &#8220;We&#8217;d as soon you
did object.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark bade him be quiet. &#8220;That&#8217;s not true,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Joel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You know, I wanted you in
this, from the first. Your coming in will&mdash;prevent
complications. With you in, the whole
matter is very simple, and safe.... But without
you, we will be forced to take measures that
may be&mdash;reprehensible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel did not speak; and Priss, trembling
against the door, thought bitterly: &#8220;He&#8217;s
afraid.... He said, himself, that he is
afraid....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dick Morrell begged eagerly: &#8220;Please, Captain
Shore. There&#8217;s a fortune for all of us.
Mr. Worthen would tell you to do it....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said then: &#8220;I told Mark Shore in the
beginning that I would not risk my ship. The
enterprise is not lawful. The pearls were
stolen in the beginning; murder hung around
them. Bad luck would follow them&mdash;and
there are blacks on the island to prevent our
finding them, in any case.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no harm in going to see,&#8221; Morrell
urged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis far out of our proper way. Wasted
time. And&mdash;the men should be thinking of oil,
not of pearls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed. &#8220;That may be,&#8221; he agreed.
&#8220;But the men&#8217;s thoughts are already on the
pearls. They&#8217;ve no mind for whaling, Joel.
They&#8217;ve no mind for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doubtful that what you say is true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His brother snapped angrily: &#8220;Do you call
me liar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Joel gently. &#8220;You were never
one to lie, Mark.&#8221; And Priss, listening,
winced at the thing that was like apology in his
tone. She heard Mark laugh again, aloud; and
she heard the fat chuckle of Jim Finch. Then
Mark said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s well you remember that. So....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
Will you go with us; or do we go without
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a long moment of silence before
Joel answered. At last he said: &#8220;You&#8217;re
making to spill blood on the <i>Nathan Ross</i>,
Mark. I&#8217;ve no mind for that. I&#8217;ll not have it&mdash;if
I can stop it. So ... I&#8217;ll consider this
matter, to-night, and give you your answer in
the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll answer now,&#8221; Varde said sullenly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s too much words and words....
You&#8217;ll answer now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer in the morning,&#8221; Joel repeated,
as though he had not heard Varde. &#8220;In the
morning. And&mdash;for now&mdash;I&#8217;ll bid you good
night, gentlemen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark chuckled. &#8220;There&#8217;s one matter, Joel.
You&#8217;ve two rifles and a pair of revolvers in
the lockfast by your cabin there. I&#8217;ll take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
them&mdash;to avoid that blood-spilling you mention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priss held her breath, listening.... But
Joel said readily: &#8220;Yes. Here is the key,
Mark. And&mdash;I hold you responsible for the
weapons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her anger at Joel for his submission beat in
her ears; and she heard the jingle of the keys,
and the scrape and ring of the weapons as Mark
took them. He called to Joel as he did so:
&#8220;They&#8217;ll not leave my hands. Till the morning,
Joel, my boy....&#8221;
</p>
<p>The keys jingled again. Mark said:
&#8220;We&#8217;ll ask you to stay in the after cabin here
till morning. And&mdash;Varde will be in the main
cabin to see that you do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay here,&#8221; Joel promised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;we&#8217;ll bid you good night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priss heard Joel echo the words, in even
tones. Then the door closed behind the men.... There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
was no further sound in the after
cabin.
</p>
<p>She opened her door. Joel stood by his desk,
head drooping, one hand resting on the open
log before him. She went toward him, and
when he turned and saw her, she stopped, and
studied him, her eyes searching his. And at
last she said, so softly it was as though she spoke
to herself:
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All the brothers were valiant,&#8217; Joel. Are
you&mdash;just a coward?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He would not justify himself to her; he could
only remember the shadowed deck beneath the
boat house&mdash;Priscilla in his brother&#8217;s arms....
He lifted his right hand a little, said
sternly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back to your place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She flung her eyes away from him, stood for
an instant, then went to her cabin with feet that
lagged and stumbled.
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
<h2>XIV</h2>
</div>

<p>Joel lay for an hour, planning what he
should do. He could not yield.... He
could not yield, even though he might wish to
do so; for the yielding would forfeit forever
all control over these men, or any others. He
could not yield....
</p>
<p>Yet he did not wish to fight; for the battle
would be hopeless, with only death at the end
for him, and it would ruin the men and lose the
ship.... Blood marks a ship with a mark that
cannot be washed away. And Joel loved his
ship; and he loved his men with something
of the love of a father for children. Children
they were. He knew them. Simple, easily
led, easily swept by some adventurous
vision....
</p>
<p>He slept, at last, dreamlessly; and in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
morning, when they came to him, he told them
what he wished to do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call the men aft,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll speak to
them. We&#8217;ll see what their will is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark mocked him. &#8220;Ask the men, is it?&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;Let them vote, you&#8217;ll be saying.
Are you master of the ship, man; or just
first selectman, that you&#8217;d call a town meeting
on the high seas?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk with the men,&#8221; said Joel stubbornly.
</p>
<p>Varde strode forward angrily. &#8220;You&#8217;ll talk
with us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes or no. Now. What
is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were in the main cabin. Joel looked
at Varde steadily for an instant; then he said:
&#8220;I&#8217;m going on deck. You&#8217;ll come....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Priss, in the door of the after cabin, a frightened
and trembling little figure, called to him:
&#8220;Joel. Joel. Don&#8217;t....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>He said, without turning: &#8220;Stay in your
cabin, Priscilla.&#8221; And then he passed between
Varde and Finch, at the foot of the companion,
and turned his back upon them and went steadily
up the steep, ladder-like stair. Varde made
a convulsive movement to seize his arm; but
Mark touched the man, held him with his eyes,
whispered something....
</p>
<p>They had left old Hooper on deck. He and
Aaron Burnham were standing in the after
house when Joel saw them. Joel said to the
third mate: &#8220;Mr. Hooper, tell the men to lay
aft.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark had come up at Joel&#8217;s heels; and
Hooper looked past Joel to Mark for confirmation.
And Mark smiled mirthlessly, and approved.
&#8220;Yes, Mr. Hooper, call the men,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;re to hold a town meeting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Old Hooper&#8217;s slow brain could not follow
such maneuvering; nevertheless, he bellowed a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
command. And the harpooners from the steerage,
and the men from forecastle and fore deck
came stumbling and crowding aft. The men
stopped amidships; and Joel went toward them
a little ways, until he was under the boat house.
The mates stood about him, the harpooners a
little to one side; and Mark leaned on the rail
at the other side of the deck, watching, smiling....
The revolvers were in his belt; the rifles
leaned against the after rail. He polished the
butt of one of the revolvers while he watched
and smiled....
</p>
<p>Joel said, without preamble: &#8220;Men, the
mates tell me that you&#8217;ve heard of my brother&#8217;s
pearls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men looked at one another, and at the
mates. They were a jumbled lot, riff-raff of
all the seas, Cape Verders, Islanders, a Cockney
or two, a Frenchman, two or three Norsemen,
and a backbone of New England stock. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
looked at one another, and at the mates, with
stupid, questioning eyes; and one or two of them
nodded in a puzzled way, and the Cape Verders
grinned with embarrassment. A New Englander
drawled:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, sir. We&#8217;ve heard th&#8217; tale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel nodded. &#8220;When my brother came
aboard at Tubuai,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;he proposed
that we go to this island.... I do not
know its position&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark drawled from across the deck: &#8220;You
know as much as any man aboard&mdash;myself excepted,
Joel. It&#8217;s my own secret, mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He proposed that we go to this island,&#8221; Joel
pursued, &#8220;and that he and I go ashore and get
the pearls and say nothing about them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Varde, at Joel&#8217;s side, swung his head and
looked bleakly at Mark Shore; and one or two
of the men murmured. Joel said quickly:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t misunderstand. I&#8217;m not blaming him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
for that. You must not. The pearls are his.
He has a right to them....
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want you to know is that I refused
to go with him and get them on half shares. I
could have had half, and refused....
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now he has spread the story among you.
And the mates say that I must go with you all,
and get the things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped, and the eyes of the men were on
him; and one or two nodded, and a voice here
and there exclaimed in approval. Joel waited
until they were quiet again; then he said:
&#8220;These&mdash;pearls&mdash;have cost life. At least five
men and a woman died in the getting of them.
If we had them aboard here, more of us would
die; for none would be content with his
share....
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in my mind that they&#8217;d bring blood
aboard the <i>Nathan Ross</i>. And I have no wish
for that. But first&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How many of you are for going after
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a murmur of assent from many
throats; and Joel looked from man to man.
&#8220;Most of you, at least,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is there any
man against going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There may have been, but no man spoke; and
over Joel&#8217;s face passed a weary little shadow of
pain. For a long moment he stood in the sun,
studying them; and they saw his lips were
white. Then he said quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not go. The <i>Nathan Ross</i> goes
on about her proper matters. The pearls stay
where they are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He shifted his weight, looked quickly toward
his brother.... He was poised for battle.
By the very force of his word, there was a
chance he might prevail. He watched the men,
in whose hands the answer lay. If he could
hold them....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>Hands clamped his arms, and Mark smiled
across the deck. Finch and old Hooper on one
side, Varde and Morrell on the other. And
after the first wrench of his surprise, he knew it
was hopeless to struggle, and stood quietly.
Mark strolled across the deck, smiling coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll not go, Joel, you must be taken,&#8221;
he said. And to the mates: &#8220;Bring back his
arms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel felt the cord slipped through his elbows
and drawn tight and looped and made secure.
Old Aaron Burnham pushed forward and
tugged at them; and Joel heard him say:
&#8220;They&#8217;ll hold him fast, Captain Shore. Like
a trussed fowl, sir. That he is....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Shore?&#8221; That would be Mark,
come into command of the ship again. And
Aaron added: &#8220;I&#8217;ve set the bolt on his cabin
door, sir. Not five minutes gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark laughed. &#8220;Good enough, Aaron.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
You and Varde take him down. Varde, you&#8217;ll
stay in the after cabin. If he tries to get free,
summon me. And&mdash;treat Mrs. Shore with the
utmost courtesy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Varde was at Joel&#8217;s side; and Joel saw the
twist of his smile at Mark&#8217;s last word. For a
moment, thought of Priss left Joel sick. He
thrust the thought aside....
</p>
<p>They took him down into the main cabin;
Varde ahead, then Joel, and old Aaron close behind,
his hand on Joel&#8217;s elbow. Priss met them
in the after cabin, crouching in a corner, white
and still, her hands at her throat. Her eyes
met his for an instant, before Varde led him
toward his own cabin. Aaron, behind, looked
toward Priss; and the girl whispered hoarsely:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he&mdash;hurt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not,&#8221; said Aaron grimly. &#8220;We were
most gentle with the man; and he made no
struggle at all....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>Varde thrust Joel into the little cabin where
his bunk was; and Joel heard the snick of a
new-set bolt on the outer side of the door. He
was alone, bound fast....
</p>
<p>Before he left the deck, he had heard Mark
cry an order to the man at the wheel. The telltale
in the after cabin ceiling told him the
<i>Nathan Ross</i> had changed her course again ... for
Mark&#8217;s island.... In the face of
men, he had held himself steady and calm....
But now, alone in his cabin, he strained at
his bonds, lips cracking over set teeth. He
strained and tugged.... Hopeless....
</p>
<p>No! Not hopeless! He felt them yield a
little, a little more.... Then, with a tiny snap
of sound, the coils were loose, and he shook the
cords down over his wrists and hands. He
caught them as they fell across his fingers, lest
the sound of their fall might warn Varde, in the
cabin outside his door; and&mdash;he was still stupefied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
by the surprise of this deliverance&mdash;he
lifted the broken bonds and examined
them....
</p>
<p>A single strand had yielded, loosing all the
rest. And where it had broken, Joel saw, it
had been sliced all but through, with a keen
blade.
</p>
<p>Who? His thoughts raced back over the
brief minutes of his bondage. Who?
</p>
<p>No other but Aaron Burnham could have had
the chance and the good will. Old Aaron.... And
Aaron&#8217;s knives were always razor
sharp. Drawn once across the tight-stretched
cord....
</p>
<p>Aaron had freed him. Aaron....
</p>
<p>He remembered something else. Aaron&#8217;s
words to Mark on deck. &#8220;I&#8217;ve set the bolt on
his cabin door....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Aaron had set the new bolt that was the only
bar between him and the after cabin, where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Varde stood watch. Aaron had set the bolt;
and Aaron had cut his bonds. Therefore&mdash;the
bolt must be flimsy, easily forced away. That
would be Aaron&#8217;s plan. A single thrust would
open the way....
</p>
<p>He turned toward the door; then caught himself,
drew back, dropped on the bunk and lay
there, planning what he must do.

<h2>XV</h2>
</div>

<p>The discovery of Aaron&#8217;s loyalty had been
immensely heartening to Joel. If Aaron
were loyal, there might be others.... Must
be.... Not all men are false....
</p>
<p>He wondered who they would be; he went
over the men, one by one, from mate to humblest
foremast hand. Finch and Varde were
surely against him. Old Hooper&mdash;he and
Aaron were cronies, and the other mates had
left Hooper somewhat out of their movements
thus far. Old Hooper might be, give him his
chance, on Joel&#8217;s side....
</p>
<p>Old Hooper, and Aaron. Two. Dick Morrell?
A boy, hot with the wonder and glamor
of Mark&#8217;s tale. Easily swung to either side.
Joel thought he would not swing too desperately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
to the lawless side. But&mdash;he could not
be counted on. What others were there?
</p>
<p>Joel had brought his own harpooner from the
<i>Martin Wilkes</i>. A big Island black. A decent
man.... A chance. Besides him, there
were three men who had served Asa Worthen
long among the foremast hands. Uncertain
quantities. Chances everywhere....
</p>
<p>But&mdash;he must strike quickly. There was no
time to sound them out. When his dinner was
brought at noon, his broken bonds would be discovered.
They would be more careful thereafter.
Three hours lay before him....
</p>
<p>He set himself to listen with all his ears; to
guess at what was going on above decks, and so
choose his moment. He must wait as long as it
was safe to wait; he must wait till men&#8217;s bloods
ran less hot after the crisis of the morning. He
must wait till sober second thought was upon
them....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>But there was always the chance to fear that
Mark might come down. He could not wait
too long....
</p>
<p>He could hear feet moving on the deck above
his head. The <i>Nathan Ross</i> had run into
rougher weather with her change of course;
the wind was stiffening, and now and then
a whisk of spray came aboard. He heard
Jim Finch&#8217;s bellowing commands.... Heard
Mark&#8217;s laughter. Mark and Jim were astern,
fairly over his head.
</p>
<p>There were men in the main cabin. The
scrape of their feet, the murmur of their voices
came to him. Dick Morrell and old Hooper,
perhaps....
</p>
<p>It was through these men that Joel&#8217;s moment
came. Finch, on deck, shouted down to them.... Mark
had decided to shorten sail, ease the
strain on the old masts. Joel heard Morrell
and Hooper go up to the deck....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>That would mean most of the men aloft....
The decks would be fairly clear. His
chance....
</p>
<p>He wished he could know where Varde sat;
but he could not be sure of that, and he could
not wait to guess by listening. He caught up a
blanket from his bunk, held it open in his hands,
drew back&mdash;and threw himself against the cabin
door.
</p>
<p>It opened so easily that he overbalanced, all
but fell. The screws had been set in punch
holes so large that the threads scarce took hold
at all. Joel stumbled out&mdash;saw Varde on the
cushioned bench which ran across the stern.
The mate was reading, a book from Joel&#8217;s narrow
shelf. At sight of Joel, he was for an instant
paralyzed with surprise....
</p>
<p>That instant was long enough for Joel. He
swept the blanket down upon the man, smothering
his cries with fold on fold; and he grappled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
Varde, and crushed him, and beat at his head
with his fists until the mate&#8217;s spasmodic struggles
slackened. Priss had heard the sounds of
combat, swept out of her cabin, bent above
them. He looked up and saw her; and he said
quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back into your place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She cried pitifully: &#8220;I want to help.
Please....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;This is my task.
Quick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She fled....
</p>
<p>He lifted Varde and carried him back to the
cabin where he himself had been captive; and
there, with the cords that had bound his own
arms, he bound Varde, wrist and ankle; and he
stripped away the blanket, and stuffed into
Varde&#8217;s mouth a heavy, woolen sock, and tied it
there with a handkerchief.... Varde&#8217;s eyes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
flickered open at the last; and Joel said to him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must leave you here for the present. You
will do well to lie quietly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left the man lying on the floor, and went
out into the after cabin and salvaged the bolt
and screws that had been sent flying by his
thrust. He put the bolt back in place, pushed
the screws into the holes, bolted the door.... No
trace remained of his escape....
</p>
<p>Priss stood in her own door. Without looking
at her, he opened the door into the main
cabin. That apartment was empty, as he had
expected. The companion stair led to the
deck....
</p>
<p>But he could not go up that way. Mark
and Jim Finch were within reach of the top of
the stair; he would be at a disadvantage, coming
up to them from below. He must reach the
deck before they saw him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>He crossed the cabin to a lockfast, and
opened it, and took out the two pairs of heavy
ship&#8217;s irons that lay there. Spring handcuffs
that locked without a key.... He put one
pair in each pocket of his coat.
</p>
<p>There was a seldom used door that opened
from the main cabin into a passage which led in
turn to the steerage where the harpooners slept.
Joel stepped to this door, slipped the bolt, entered
the passage, and closed the door behind
him.
</p>
<p>It was black dark, where he stood. The passage
was unlighted; and the swinging lamp in
the steerage did not send its rays this far. The
<i>Nathan Ross</i> was heeling and bucking heavily
in the cross seas, and Joel chose his footing carefully,
and moved forward along the passage, his
hands braced against the wall on either side.
The way was short, scarce half a dozen feet;
but he was long in covering the distance, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
paused frequently to listen. He had no wish
to encounter the harpooners in their narrow
quarters....
</p>
<p>He heard, at last, the muffled sound of a
snore; and so covered the last inches of his way
more quickly. When he was able to look into
the place, he saw that two of the men were in
their bunks, apparently asleep. The black
whom he had brought from the <i>Nathan Ross</i>
was not there. Joel was glad to think he was
on deck; glad to hope for the chance of his
help....
</p>
<p>With steps so slow he seemed like a shadow
in the semi-darkness, he crossed to the foot of
the ladder that led to the deck. The men in
their bunks still slept. He began to climb.... The
ship was rolling heavily, so that he
was forced to grip the ladder tightly.... One
of the sleepers stirred, and Joel froze where he
stood, and watched, and waited for endless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
seconds till the man became quiet once more.
</p>
<p>He climbed till his head was on a level with
the deck still hidden by the sides of the scuttle
at the top of the ladder. And there he poised
himself; for the last steps to the deck must be
made in a single rush, so quickly that interference
would be impossible....
</p>
<p>He made them; one ... three.... He
stood upon the deck, looked aft....
</p>
<p>Mark and Jim Finch stood there, not ten feet
away from him. Finch&#8217;s back was turned, but
Mark saw Joel instantly; and Joel, watching,
saw Mark&#8217;s mouth widen in a broad and mischievously
delighted smile.
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
<h2>XVI</h2>
</div>

<p>At the moment when Joel reached the
deck, the other men aboard the <i>Nathan
Ross</i> were widely scattered.
</p>
<p>Varde, the second mate, he had left tied and
helpless in the cabin. Two of the four harpooners
were below in their bunks, asleep. The
greater part of one watch was likewise below,
in the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le; and the rest of the crew, under
Dick Morrell&#8217;s eye, were shortening sail. In
the after part of the ship there were only Mark
Shore, Finch, a foremast hand at the wheel, old
Aaron Burnham, and the cook. Of these,
Mark, Jim, and the man at the wheel were in
sight when Joel appeared; and only Mark had
seen him.
</p>
<p>Joel saw his brother smile, and stood for an
instant, poised to meet an attack. None came.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
He swept his eyes forward and saw that he need
fear no immediate interference from that direction;
and so he went quietly toward the men
astern. The broad back of Jim Finch was
within six feet of him....
</p>
<p>What moved Mark Shore in that moment, it
is hard to say. It may have been the reckless
spirit of the man, willing to wait and watch and
see what Joel would do; or it may have been the
distaste he must have felt for Jim Finch&#8217;s slavish
adulation; or it may have been an unadmitted
admiration for Joel&#8217;s courage....
</p>
<p>At any rate, while Joel advanced, Mark stood
still and smiled; and he gave Finch no warning,
so that when Joel touched the mate&#8217;s elbow,
Finch whirled with a startled gasp of surprise
and consternation, and in his first panic, tried to
back away. Still Mark made no move. The
man at the wheel uttered one exclamation,
looked quickly at Mark for commands, and took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
his cue from his leader. Finch was left alone
and unsupported to face Joel.
</p>
<p>Joel did not pursue the retreating mate. He
stepped to the rail, where the whaleboats hung,
and called to Finch quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Finch, step here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finch had retreated until his shoulders were
braced against the wall of the after house. He
leaned there, hands outspread against the wall
behind him, staring at Joel with goggling eyes.
And Joel said again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, Mr. Finch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel&#8217;s composure, and the determination and
the confidence in his tone, frightened Finch.
He clamored suddenly: &#8220;How did he get here,
Captain Shore? Jump him. Tie him up&mdash;you&mdash;Aaron....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He appealed to the man at the wheel, and to
old Aaron, who had appeared in the doorway of
the tiny compartment where his tools were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
stored. Neither stirred. Mark Shore, chuckling,
stared at Finch and at Joel; and Finch
cried:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Shore. Come on. Let&#8217;s get
him....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel said for the third time: &#8220;Come here,
Finch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finch held out a hand to Mark, appealingly.
Mark shook his head. &#8220;This is your affair,
Finch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Go get him, yourself. He&#8217;s
waiting for you. And&mdash;you&#8217;re twice his size.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Give Finch his due. With even moral support
behind him, he would have overwhelmed
Joel in a single rush. Without that support,
he would still have faced any reasonable attack.
But there was something baffling about Joel&#8217;s
movements, his tones, the manner of his command,
that stupefied Finch. He felt that he
was groping in the dark. The mutiny must
have collapsed.... It may have been only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
a snare to trap him.... He was alone&mdash;against
Joel, and with none to support him....
</p>
<p>Finch&#8217;s courage was not of the solitary kind.
He took one slow step toward Joel, and in that
single step was surrender.
</p>
<p>Joel stood still, but his eyes held the big
man&#8217;s; and he said curtly: &#8220;Quickly, Finch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finch took another lagging step, another....
</p>
<p>Joel dropped his hand in his coat pocket and
drew out a pair of irons. He tossed them toward
Finch; and the mate shrank, and the
irons struck him in the body and fell to the deck.
He stared down at them, stared at Joel.
</p>
<p>Joel said: &#8220;Pick them up. Snap one on your
right wrist. Then put your arms around the
davit, there, and snap the other....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finch shook his head in a bewildered way, as
though trying to understand; and abruptly, a
surge of honest anger swept him, and he stiffened,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
and wheeled to rush at Joel. But Joel
made no move either to retreat or to meet the
attack; and Finch, like a huge and baffled bear,
slumped again, and slowly stooped, and gathered
up the handcuffs....
</p>
<p>With them in his hands, he looked again at
Joel; and for a long moment their eyes battled.
Then Joel stepped forward, touched Finch
lightly on the arm, and guided him toward the
rail. Finch was absolutely unresisting. The
sap had gone out of him....
</p>
<p>Joel drew the man&#8217;s arms around the davit,
and snapped the irons upon his wrist. Finch
was fast there, out of whatever action there was
to come. And Joel&#8217;s lips tightened with relief.
He stepped back....
</p>
<p>He saw, then, that some of the crew had
heard, and three or four of them were gathering
amidships, near the try works. The two
harpooners were there; and one of them was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
that black whom Joel had brought from the
<i>Martin Wilkes</i>, and in whom he placed some
faith. He eyed these men for a moment, wondering
whether they were nerved to strike....
</p>
<p>But they did not stir, they did not move toward
him; and he guessed they were as stupefied
as Finch by what had happened. So long
as the men aft allowed him to go free, they
would not interfere. They did not understand;
and without understanding, they were
helpless.
</p>
<p>He turned his back on them, and looked toward
Mark.
</p>
<p>Mark Shore had watched Joel&#8217;s encounter
with Finch in frank enjoyment. Such incidents
pleased him; they appealed to his love
for the bold and daring facts of life.... He
had smiled.
</p>
<p>But now Joel saw that he had stepped back a
little, perhaps by accident. He was behind the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
man at the wheel, behind the spot where Aaron
Burnham stood. He was standing almost
against the after rail, in the narrow corridor
that runs fore and aft through the after
house....
</p>
<p>The pistols were in his belt, and the two
rifles leaned on the rail at his side. Mark himself
was standing at ease, his arms relaxed, his
hands resting lightly on his hips and his feet
apart. He swayed to the movement of the
ship, balancing with the unconscious ease of
long custom.
</p>
<p>Joel went toward him, not slowly, yet without
haste. He passed old Aaron with no word,
passed the wheelman, and faced his brother.
They were scarce two feet apart when he
stopped; and there were no others near enough
to hear, above the slashing of the seas and the
whistle of the wind, his low words.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Mark, you&#8217;ve made a mistake. A
bad mistake. In&mdash;starting this mutiny.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark smiled slowly. &#8220;That&#8217;s a hard word,
Joel. It&#8217;s in my mind that if this is mutiny,
it&#8217;s a very peaceful model.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, it is just that,&#8221; said Joel.
&#8220;It is that, and it is also a mistake. And&mdash;you
are wise man enough to see this. There
is still time to remedy the thing. It can be forgotten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark chuckled. &#8220;If that is true, you&#8217;ve a
most convenient memory, Joel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel&#8217;s cheeks flushed slowly, and he answered:
&#8220;I am anxious to forget&mdash;whatever
shames the House of Shore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark threw back his head and laughed aloud.
&#8220;Bless you, boy,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;&#8217;Tis no
shame to you to have fallen victim to our
numbers.&#8221; But there was a heat in his tones
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
that told Joel he was shaken. And Joel insisted
steadily:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not my own shame I feared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine, then?&#8221; Mark challenged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said Joel. &#8220;Yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark bent toward him with a mocking flare
of anger in his eyes; and he said harshly:
&#8220;You&#8217;ve spoken too much for a small man. Be
silent. And go below.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel waited for an instant; then his shoulders
stirred as though he chose a hard course,
and he held out his hand and said quietly: &#8220;Give
me the guns, Mark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark stared at him; and he laughed aloud.
&#8220;You&#8217;re immense, boy,&#8221; he applauded. &#8220;The
cool nerve of you....&#8221; His eyes warmed
with frank admiration. &#8220;Joel, hark to this,&#8221;
he cried, and jerked his head toward the captive
Finch. &#8220;You&#8217;ve ripped the innards out of that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
mate of mine. I&#8217;ll give you the job. You&#8217;re
mate of the <i>Nathan Ross</i> and I&#8217;m proud to
have you....&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am captain of the <i>Nathan Ross</i>,&#8221; said
Joel. &#8220;And you are my brother, and a&mdash;mutineer.
Give me the guns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark threw up his hand angrily. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
not hear reason. Then&mdash;go below, and stay
there. You....&#8221;
</p>
<p>There are few men who can stand flat-footed
and still hit a crushing blow; but Joel did just
this. When Mark began to speak, Joel&#8217;s hands
had been hanging limply at his sides. On
Mark&#8217;s last word, Joel&#8217;s right hand whipped up
as smoothly as a whip snaps; and it smacked on
Mark&#8217;s lean jaw with much the sound a whip
makes. It struck just behind the point of the
jaw, on the left hand side; and Mark&#8217;s head
jerked back, and his knees sagged, and he tottered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
weakly forward into Joel&#8217;s very arms.
</p>
<p>Joel&#8217;s hands were at the other&#8217;s belt, even as
Mark fell. He brought out the revolvers, then
let Mark slip down to the deck; and he stepped
over the twitching body of his brother, and
caught up the two rifles, and dropped them,
with the revolvers, over the after rail.
</p>
<p>Mark&#8217;s splendid body had already begun to
recover from the blow; he was struggling to sit
up, and he saw what Joel did, and cried aloud:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool, boy. Keep them....
Hell!&#8221; For the weapons were gone. Joel
turned, and looked down at him; and he said
quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;While I can help it, there&#8217;ll be no blood shed
on my ship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mark swept an arm toward the waist of the
ship, and Joel looked and saw a growing knot
of angry men there. &#8220;See them, do you?&#8221;
Mark demanded. &#8220;They&#8217;re drunk for blood.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
It&#8217;s out of your hands, Joel. You&#8217;ve thrown
your ace away. Now, boy&mdash;what will you
do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men began to surge aft, along the deck.
</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>
</div>

<p>THE story of that battle upon the tumbling
decks of the <i>Nathan Ross</i> was to
be told and re-told at many a gam upon the
whaling grounds. It was such a story as strong
men love; a story of overwhelming odds, of
epic combat, of splendid death where blood ran
hot and strong....
</p>
<p>There were a full score of men in the group
that came aft toward Joel. And as they came,
others, running from the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le and dropping
from the rigging, joined them. Every man
was drunk with the vision of wealth that he had
built upon Mark Shore&#8217;s story. The thing had
grown and grown in the telling; it had fattened
on the greed native in the men; and it was a
monstrous thing now, and one that would not be
denied.... The men, as they moved aft,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
made grumbling sounds with their half-caught
breath; and these sounds blended into a roaring
growl like the growl of a beast.
</p>
<p>To face these men stood Joel. For an instant,
he was alone. Then, without word, old
Aaron took his stand beside his captain. Aaron
held gripped in both hands an adze. Its edge
was sharp enough to slice hard wood like
cheese.... And at Joel&#8217;s other side, the cook.
A round man, with greasy traces of his craft
upon his countenance. He carried a heavy
cleaver. There is an ancient feud between galley
and fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le; and the men greeting the
cook&#8217;s coming with a hungry cry of delight....
</p>
<p>Joel glanced at these new allies, and saw
their weapons. He took the adze from Aaron,
the cleaver from the other; and he turned and
hurled them behind him, over the rail. And in
the moment&#8217;s silence that followed on this
action, he called to the men:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go back to your places.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They growled at him; they were wordless,
but they knew the thing they desired. The
cook complained at Joel&#8217;s elbow: &#8220;I could use
that cleaver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not have blood spilled,&#8221; Joel told him.
&#8220;If there&#8217;s fighting, it will be with fists....&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Mark touched Joel lightly on the shoulder,
and took his place beside him. He was
smiling, a twisted smile above the swollen
lump upon his jaw. He said lightly: &#8220;If it&#8217;s
fists, Joel&mdash;I think I&#8217;m safest to fight beside
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel looked up at him with a swift glance,
and he brushed his hand across his eyes, and
nodded. &#8220;I counted on that, Mark&mdash;in the
last, long run,&#8221; he said. Mark gripped his
arm and pressed it; and in that moment the
long, unspoken enmity between the brothers
died forever. They faced the men....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>One howled like a wolf: &#8220;He&#8217;s done us.
Done us in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And another: &#8220;They&#8217;re going to hog it.
Them two....&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little sea of scowling, twisting faces
moved, it surged forward.... The men
charged, more than a score, to overwhelm the
four.
</p>
<p>In the moment before, Joel had marked
young Dick Morrell, at one side, twisted
with indecision; and in the instant when
the men moved, he called: &#8220;With us, Mr.
Morrell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was command, not question; and the boy
answered with a shout and a blow.... On the
flank of the men, he swept toward them. And
Joel&#8217;s harpooner, and one of Asa Worthen&#8217;s
old men formed a triumvirate that fought
there....
</p>
<p>They were thus seven against a score. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
they were seven good men. And the score
were a mob....
</p>
<p>It was fists, at the first, as Joel had sworn.
The first, charging line broke upon them; and
old Aaron was swept back, fighting like a cat,
and crushed and bruised and left helpless in an
instant. The fat cook dodged into his galley,
and snatched a knife and held the door there,
prodding the flanks of those who swirled past
his stronghold. Joel dropped the first man
who came to him; and likewise Mark. But
another twined &#8217;round Joel&#8217;s legs, and he could
not kick them free, and there was no time to
stoop and tear the man away.
</p>
<p>He and Mark kept back to back for a moment;
but Mark was not a defensive fighter.
He could not stand still and wait attack; and
when his second man fell, he leaped the twisting
body and charged into the clump of them. His
black hair tossed, his eye was flaming; and his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
long arms worked like pistons and like flails.
He became the center of a group that writhed
and dissolved, and formed again. His head
rose above them all.
</p>
<p>The man who gripped Joel&#8217;s legs, freed one
hand and began to beat at Joel&#8217;s body from below.
Joel could not endure the blows; he
bent, and took a rain of buffets on his head
and shoulders while he caught the attacker by
the throat, and lifted him up and flung him
away. He staggered free, set his back against
the galley wall; and when he shifted to avoid
another attack, he found his place in the galley
door. The fat cook crouched behind him, and
Joel heard him shout: &#8220;I&#8217;ll watch your legs,
Cap&#8217;n. Give &#8217;em the iron, sir. Give &#8217;em th&#8217;
iron.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Once Joel, looking down, saw the cook&#8217;s
knife play like a flame between his knees....
None would seek to pin him there.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>The black harpooner fought his way across
the deck to Joel&#8217;s side. He left a trail of
twisting bodies behind him. And he was grinning
with a huge delight. &#8220;Now, sar, we&#8217;ll do
&#8217;em, sar,&#8221; he screamed. The sweat poured
down his black cheeks; and his mouth was cut
and bleeding. His shirt was torn away from
one shoulder and arm....
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good man,&#8221; said Joel, between his panting
blows. &#8220;Good man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Across the deck, one who had run forward
for a handspike swept it down on young Dick
Morrel&#8217;s brown head. Morrell dodged, but
the blow cracked his shoulder and swept him
to the deck. The man who had fought beside
him spraddled the prostrate body, and jerked
an iron from the boat on the davits at his back
and held it like a lance, to keep all men at a
distance. A sheath knife sped, and twisted in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
the air, and struck him butt first above the eye,
so that he fell limply and lay still....
</p>
<p>Mark Shore had been forced against the rail
near where Jim Finch was pinned. Big Finch
was howling and weeping with fright; and a
little man of the crew with a rat&#8217;s mean soul
who hated Finch had found his hour. He was
leaping about the mate, lashing him mercilessly
with a heavy end of rope; and Finch screamed
and twisted beneath the blows.
</p>
<p>So swiftly had the tumult of the battle arisen
that all these things had come to pass before
the harpooners asleep in the steerage could wake
and reach the deck. When they climbed the
ladder, and looked about them, they saw Morrell
and his ally prostrate at one side, Joel and
the cook holding the galley door against a half
dozen men; and big Mark&#8217;s towering head
amidst a knot of half a dozen more. And one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
of the harpooners backed away toward the waist
of the ship, watchful and wary, taking no part
in the affair.
</p>
<p>But the other ... He was a Cape Verder,
black blood crossed with Spanish; and Mark
Shore had tied him to a davit, once upon a
time, and lashed him till he bled, for faults
committed. He saw Mark now, and his eyes
shone greedily.
</p>
<p>This man crouched, and crossed to a boat&mdash;his
own&mdash;and chose his own harpoon. He
twisted off the wooden sheath that covered the
point, and flung it across the deck; and he poised
the heavy iron in his hands, and started slowly
toward Mark, moving on tiptoe, lightly as a
cat.
</p>
<p>Mark saw him coming; and the big man
shouted joyfully: &#8220;Why, Silva! Come,
you....&#8221;
</p>
<p>He flung aside the men encircling him. One
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
among them held the handspike with which he
had struck down Morrell; and Mark smote this
man in the body, and when he doubled,
wrenched the great club from his hands. He
swung this, leaped to meet the harpooner.
</p>
<p>They came together in mid-deck. The
great handspike whistled through the air, and
down. An egg-shell crunched beneath a heel....
Silva dropped.
</p>
<p>Mark stood for an instant above him; and in
that instant, every man saw the harpoon which
Silva had driven home. Its heavy shaft hung,
dragging on the deck; it hung from Mark&#8217;s
breast, high in the right shoulder; and the point
stood out six inches behind his shoulder blade.
It seemed to drag at him; he bent slowly beneath
its weight, and drooped, and lay at last
across the body of the man whose skull the
handspike had crushed.
</p>
<p>There were, at that moment, about a dozen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
of the men still on their feet; but in the instant
of their paralyzed dismay, two things struck
them; two furies ... Dick Morrell, tottering
on unsteady feet, brandishing a razor-tipped
lance full ten feet long. He came upon the
men from the flank, shouting; and Joel, when
he saw his brother fall, left his shelter in the
galley door and swept upon them. The fat
cook, with the knife, fought nobly at his side.
</p>
<p>The men broke; they fled headlong, forward;
and Joel and Morrell and the cook pursued
them, through the waist, past the trypots,
till they tumbled down the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le scuttle and
huddled in their bunks and howled....
</p>
<p>A dozen limp bodies sprawled upon the deck,
bodies of moaning men with heads that would
ache and pound for days.... Joel left Morrell
to guard the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le, and went back among
them, going swiftly from man to man....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Silva was dead. The others would not die&mdash;save
only Mark. The iron had pierced his
chest, had ripped a lung....
</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p>He died that night, smiling to the last.
He was able to speak, now and then,
before the end; and Joel and Priss were near
him, at his side, soothing him, listening....
</p>
<p>He asked Joel, once: &#8220;Shall I tell you&mdash;where&mdash;pearls...&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel shook his head. &#8220;I do not want them,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;They have enough blood to turn
them crimson. Let them lie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Mark smiled, and nodded faintly.
&#8220;Right, boy. Let them lie....&#8221; And his
eyes shone up at them; and he whispered presently:
&#8220;That was&mdash;a fight to tell about,
Joel....&#8221;
</p>
<p>In those hours beside Mark, Priss completed
the transition from girl to woman. She was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
very sober, and quiet; but she did not weep, and
she answered Mark&#8217;s smiles. And Mark,
watching her, seemed to remember something,
toward the last. Joel saw his eyes beckon; and
he bent above his brother, and Mark whispered
weakly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Treasure&mdash;Priss, Joel. She&#8217;s&mdash;worth all....
Kissed her, but she fought me....&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joel gripped his brother&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I knew
there was no&mdash;harm in you&mdash;or in her,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble, Mark....&#8221;
</p>
<p>When old Aaron had stitched the canvas
shroud, they laid Mark on the cutting stage;
and Joel read over him from the Book, while
the men stood silent by. Chastened men, heads
bandaged, arms in slings ... Big Jim Finch
at one side, shamed of face. Varde, sullen as
ever, but with hopelessness writ large upon him.
Morrell, and old Hooper....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>Joel finished, and he closed the Book.
&#8220;Unto the deep....&#8221; The cutting stage
tilted, and the wave leaped and caught its burden
and bore it softly down.... The sun was
shining, the sea danced, the wind was warm on
fair Priscilla&#8217;s cheek....
</p>
<p>And as though, the brief, dramatic chapter
being ended, another must at once begin, the
masthead man presently called down to Joel the
long, droning hail:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah-h-h-h! Blow-w-w-w-w!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he flung his arm toward where a misty
spout sparkled in the sun a mile or two
away. Minutes later, the boats took water;
and the <i>Nathan Ross</i> was about her business
again.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Joel wrote in the log that night, with Priscilla
beside him, her fingers in his hair. Priscilla
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
had been very humble, till Joel took her
in his arms and comforted her....
</p>
<p>He set down the ship&#8217;s position; he recorded
their capture, that day, of a great bull cachalot;
and then:
</p>
<p>&#8220;... This day Mark Shore was buried at
sea. He died late last night, from wounds received
when he fought valiantly to put down
the mutiny of the crew. Fourth brother of the
House of Shore....&#8221;
</p>
<p>And below, the ancient and enduring epitaph:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;All the brothers were valiant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Priscilla, reading over his shoulder, pointed
to this line and whispered sorrowfully: &#8220;But I&mdash;called
you coward, Joel.&#8221; He looked up at
her, and smiled a little. &#8220;I know better now,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;So&mdash;give me the pen ... And
close your eyes....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>He heard the scratch of steel on paper; and
when he opened his eyes again he saw that Priscilla
had underscored, with three deep strokes,
the first word of that honorable line.
